Just when you thought good customer service was a thing of the past.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Plessers was recommended to me by my kitchen designer at Coastal Cabinets. I had no experience with this company before. So I did some research and learned that it was a well established family business that has been open for a long time. I drove out to the store and met Alan. I can not say enough about Alan his knowledge and professionalism was second to none. He helped me to make stressful decisions with ease and had great recommendations when I asked. Even after ordering my kitchen appliances Alan has been there every time I have needed him. And now I'm actually getting delivery of my products and like everything else it has been smooth as silk. I would recommend Plessers to anyone who wants to be treated like they are the only customer on the planet.,2024-05-22T19:15:21.000Z

My refrigerator was delivered on-time but I had a problem with the trucking company.…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,My refrigerator was delivered on-time and in very good condition. The only problem was the delivery people. They measured my door frames and concluded that my old appliance was too big to be taken to the truck. I asked them about removing the hinges on the front to get the correct spacing to remove the appliance. They said no and left. Now I have to remove these hinges myself and remove the appliance. I think the least Plessers could do is cancel my appliance removal since it didn't get taken.,2024-05-17T22:55:10.000Z

Poor service and communication,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Plessers stated they had a dryer in stock that they did not have, which is what caused us to order from them instead of a local retailer or big box chain, which did not have our choice of dryer in stock. When Plessers realized they didn’t have our dryer, we received a call from Mike who stated we could cancel our order or wait until the dryer was in stock, and that we could change our minds at any time. We eventually changed our minds and called the direct line to Mike that we were asked to use to cancel our order. After not hearing for four days, I called the general Plessers line and was told the item had shipped and that the order could not be cancelled without a return shipping fee. Days later I received a notification that my dryer had shipped. the associate was either wring about the ship date, or Plessers order status has lagged by two to three days. I called Plessers a third time and reached customer service, which insisted orders could only be cancelled in writing before an item shipped, which directly contradicted the instructions we received from Mike to call him directly to cancel our order. Today we have not received our dryer still in spite of the final mile service, AM Transit, having received our dryer four days ago. We have not even received a called from AM to schedule our delivery.",2024-04-29T17:08:28.000Z

"Good buying experience, but beware the extended warranty",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased an induction cooktop. The price was competitive, and the item was shipped promptly. Given the cost of the cooktop and fears of damage during shipment, I paid for the Gold Insured Inside Uncrated & Inspected delivery; this option is a bit expensive IMO for what is covered, particularly when the delivery crew tried to claim that it included bringing the cooktop into the kitchen, but not sliding it into its slot (happily, they did end up doing so after some minor grumbling). In the end, I was happy with the ordering process, speed of shipment and delivery. I dinged my review one star because of the after-sales call I received regarding the purchase of an extended warranty. I ended up purchasing it after the salesman stated that I would get half the cost back if there were no claims at the end of the warranty period; he did NOT mention that this would be handled as a store credit to be used within 60 days of receiving the credit, which I find very deceptive. Fortunately, Plesser's was quick to cancel and refund the extended warranty upon my request.",2024-04-06T23:53:31.000Z

In my case this was deceptive. I purchased a wall oven because it showed as in stock and the price was better than all other suppliers. However the ""blue ribbon"" delivery charge where 2 men will unpack and install put the price above and there was no alternate delivery option. The item took 2 months to arrive with several notices of delayed delivery and sat in storage at nearest city for another week. In the interim, it because available at my local Lowes and Home Depot within a month and I could have just picked it up the same day.

Although I was required to pay an extra $79 for “white glove” delivery service and it took 20 days with very little tracking info in between to get across the country, the stove arrived without a scratch or dent and looked brand new as I’d expect. If there were a problem, I’m not sure how Plesser’s would have dealt with it, but the fact that there wasn’t a problem was quite a relief. Two big thumbs up from me.",2024-03-14T04:49:18.000Z

Shipping company that Plesser’s used was horrible. AM DELIVERY. Multiple challenges w delivery, Plesser’s would not support. 3 days taken off work bc of flaky delivery.2. Install finally occurred, dishwasher did not work. Multiple attempts to get Plesser’s to facilitate exchange of non-functional new dishwasher.3. Replacement dishwasher finally delivered by another 3rd party (JB Hunt). ‘Installers’ who were actually just shippers, did not know what they were doing, could not remove non-functioning new dishwasher, and damaged countertop trying to ram it out. They had to file a claim w shipping company for damage.4. New replacement dishwasher left in kitchen, water left disconnected, counter damaged, still no dishwasher installed.5. Whirlpool won’t talk to me because Plesser’s completed the exchange request, so they will only communicate w Plesser’s. 6. Plesser’s won’t do anything bc they say it’s whirlpool’s responsibility. Both the sales rep who sold me the dishwasher and the customer service rep handling the exchange no longer work at Plesser’s. No one will step up. 7. Plesser’s has my money, I do not have a dishwasher installed, I now have a damaged countertop and the hassle of  claim. 8. 7 weeks later, still waiting for anyone to step up and solve the problem.9.

Kind of a mixed bag here,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Kind of a mixed bag here, I enjoyed working with the Plesser’s sales person who arranged for a very good deal on my Bosch B36CL80SNS refrigerator.  It took a while to receive it.  Delivered by AM Home Delivery.  Beautiful expensive refrigerator arrived with a dented back panel.  I immediately called my sales person but only got a voice mail stating that he would be out for a few days.  I then tried calling customer service twice but was only able to reach Plesser’s voice mail.  The voice mail said that they would get back to me today but I needed to know what to do ie accept the refrigerator and get a new back panel or just to refuse the delivery.  I then called Plesser’s sales dept and received great assistance,  Plesser’s ordered a new back panel and had a Bosch rep install it.  The irritation was with AM Home Delivery as the workers had zero patience waiting on me with my phone calls and wanted to leave or take the refrigerator back.  Their office repeatedly called me when I was trying to get direction from Plesser’s as to what to do.  The delivery service also arrived earlier than scheduled.  This was supposed to be a gold level delivery.  I would not like to experience a lower level.  The delivery company’s antsy can’t wait position was especially irritating.  Plesser’s has worked hard to get me satisfied which I appreciate.  They seem to have a very good reputation as I checked the Better Business Bureau about them before ordering.  I then did have a problem with the water line hookup which worked great on my older GE WHIRLPOOL, but didn’t fit our new Bosch.  The Bosch rep was very helpful during his visit.

BE CAUTIOUS BUYING LIEBHERR REFRIGERATOR,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I’m going to try and write a review of my Liebherr CS2082, CS2092 and CBS2092 refrigerators without writing a book. Besides Liebherr, I dealt with retailer Plessers and distributer Almo. If you look at the chart below with major dates, you will notice that it took 1,042 days for me to get my third Liebherr refrigerator after the first two failed beyond repair and were replaced by Liebherr. I hope our latest Liebherr refrigerator lasts at least the 12 years that is the average life of a refrigerator according to the U.S. Department of Energy. We remodeled our kitchen during late 2020 to early 2021, and our contractor ordered us our first Liebherr refrigerator, a CS2082. We liked the refrigerator except that water continuously accumulated under a vegetable drawer, requiring my wife to mop it up weekly. After 881 days of many failed attempts by local repair company under contract with Liebherr to fix problem, causing many emails and phone conversations between us and Liebherr, and with the two-year warranty now expired, Liebherr refunded us our purchase price. Therefore, we purchased the now upgraded model, a CS2092, this time from Plessers Appliance in New York because, at the time, they were the best source. However, from the moment our CS2092 was installed, the freezer section never worked. Its compressor never started. After 151 days of not having a freezer, with many emails and phone calls between Plessers, Liebherr and Liebherr’s distributor Almo, we finally got our second replacement refrigerator, a CBS2092 this time. As I write this, this new refrigerator has been apparently working correctly for four days! Wife is dreaming again about bringing home frozen items from Costco.DATE ACTION10/02/20 Ordered CS2082 from my contractor for $5,776.93.03/29/21 CS2082 was installed. Had Water accumulation problemsfrom beginning.08/08/23 After 7 failed attempts to fix refrigerator, Liebherr issuedme $5,776.93 refund check.08/13/23 Ordered CS2092 from Plessers for $8,144.82.09/06/23 CS2093 installed. Freezer was dead on arrival.12/14/23 Liebherr offered “Dealer Credit” to replace CS2092 aftermultiple failed repair attempts.01/19/24 Liebherr offered to simply replace CS2092 with CBS209202/03/24 CBS2092 installed. Freezer works!I delt with three different companies and multiple employees from each one. Therefore, my reviews vary by individual. The principal folks I delt with include the following: COMPANY/INDIVIDUAL/MY EXPERIENCEPlessers/Mario Perez, Sales/Not good: Typical salesman but tried to charge me retail for replacement.Plessers Nyra Elliott, Cust Serv/Good: Worked hard trying to get Liebherr and Almo to replace failed unit.Liebherr Shawn Warr, Cust Serv/Horrible: Talks over you, doesn't listen, caused me to shout/swear at him.Liebherr Oscar Colon, Cust Serv/Good: Stepped in towards end and finally arranged to get unit replaced.Almo/Brook Nilsson, Cust Serv/OK: Pleasant but could only follow rules and do what Liebherr says.I don’t know what to say about Liebherr’s hardware, their refrigerators. They are supposed to reflect superior engineering and materials, and therefore be reliable, but obviously in my experience that was not the case. I should point out that the three models I had/have, the CS2082, CS2092 and CBS2092, are standalone, verses built-in, refrigerators. However, they are sized more like cabinet-depth built-ins verses typical standalones, i.e. they are approximately 36” wide, 24” deep, but their height is near 80” whereas a typical built-in is 84”. A typical standalone can be 36” wide, but its depth will likely be 33” and its height only 72”, so a bit larger in internal volume. When I was trying to replace my second failed unit, my CS2092, I searched other brands for a replacement the same size so I would not have to redo my cabinets, but there are few if any standalones that would have worked, and built-ins which could have worked seemed more expensive than standalones. For this reason, and because we like size, appearance, and function (when it is operating correctly), we decided to give Liebherr a third and last chance. If you buy a CS2092 or CBS2092, I hope you will have much better luck than I have had.",2024-02-07T03:54:02.000Z

Rushed Installation and Bad Service,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Guy came on time 7am and was excited to be efficient. As it turned out it was just rushed. Our dishwasher is not level or flush, and the installer actually was deceptive when showing his level and claiming that my kitchen cabinet on the right side of the dishwasher wasn’t “level”.I gave him a chance when I held the level myself and did the “push” action to showcase the forced state vs the actual shoddy and rushed installation.They left by 8am and I reported the issue minutes after. I finally got a call back around 9:45am and was told it cannot be fixed until next week. Thats BS. It should be fixed today. PC Richard offered much lower prices, so if I have to wait a week to fix this shotty installation, I will simply have them remove the unit and my money refunded.",2024-01-31T16:56:45.000Z

Get what you pay for,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"The one thing that a store like Plesser's Appliance have is the products that they sell in the store. Today, many of the appliance store don't have the products in the store, just on their online store. you can not touch it, you can not feel the difference of why you are paying so much for x. It may sound like an old thing, but you will live with your appliance for some time. You will use it for some time. Pay for the right product in your life. To me, I wanted a good product for my kitchen, because other cheaper products failed my family during a holiday family event. Don't let that happen your family, do not buy Samsung Kitchen products or anything for that matter greater that a TV. I really like my Blue Star Range. It over preforms at doing the job and it seems to be built to cook food at a professional level, which truly enjoy on in my life and on my Youtube channel - BFAMCooking",2024-01-23T18:07:35.000Z

After not having a refrigerator for 2 weeks, Mike and Plesser’s literally swooped in with a solution and became our heroes.  What truly sets Mike apart is his dedication to customer satisfaction.

Mike's proactive approach and determination resulted in a successful resolution, and we were able to replace our problematic refrigerator.Plesser's Appliances, as a whole, provides an excellent shopping experience, boasting a wide selection of high-quality products and a welcoming atmosphere. The customer service we received from Mike was nothing short of exceptional, and we are now loyal customers thanks to his efforts.If you're in need of top-notch appliances and unparalleled customer service, look no further than Plesser's Appliances.

Our last purchase however fell far short or our previous experiences.Starting with the delivery and installation of our $6500 purchase the delivery men where extremely courteous and respectful.  Unfortunately our newly finished hardwood floors were scraped with their hand trucks, and the refrigerator waterline was improperly installed. As as result the floors are left that way, and we had GE Appliance service come to our house twice to replace parts and fix the problem.We were also not informed by our salesman that our stove required a Trim Kit to complete the installation. When we called him his response was Oh yes they don't come with them anymore, and we don't handle that-- just go to Home Depot and buy one they're all the same. Not much support after spending $6500!!We instead went to your website and found the kit listed, and ordered it through GE Parts.

The delivery driver called Plessers immediately, and Daniel Lastraglio, Escalations Coordinator responded in an exceptional manner: Plessers would either replace the unit, give me a credit for the damage, or give me a complete 5-year warranty on the fridge.

The deliver was set for 2:30 to 6pm.  The delivery guy showed up at 2pm.  I received a call from the delivery guy asking when I would be home. I stated that my appointment time was from 2:30 to 6.  The guy refused to wait half an hour and said that he needed to get to his next appointment.  Long story short, I refused the next delivery day attempt.  This is not how you take care of your customer. You don't show up ahead of schedule and refused to wait for the appointment time.  I will never do business with Plesser again.",2023-11-09T18:32:52.000Z

Plesser's has great pricing,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's has great pricing!  I shopped during a sale, added things to my cart then called a rep to finalize my purchase.  My only issue was a wrong item was substituted after I ordered.  I noticed and called immediately.  it took several days to get it corrected.  The price of one of the items dropped online, but the rep was not able to adjust the price.  I inquired about adding a warranty for no cost and was denied.  Shipping was another story.  I had zero control over the delivery date.  The company plesser's works with in my area is not customer friendly.  They attempted to schedule a delivery twice during days I had previously told them I wouldn't be in town.  When they arrived they couldn't figure out how to get the fridge through the front door, they weren't going to un box (even though I had white glove service) and they refused to take the boxes with them... not happy about that part.",2023-11-03T16:34:48.000Z

Plessers was great,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Plessers was great. The delivery company they used was less great. They gave me a four hour window for delivery. My contractor made sure to be here but they weren't. Delivered late after 5pm and after my contractor already left. Guys who delivered got it in the house fine but left all the packaging trash on the front lawn. I don't know if the refrigerator was knocked around during shipping. It made a high pitched continuous noise when first plugged in and the next day when I called service. It has since stopped. It was also a bit difficult to schedule delivery. They use robocalls and emails to confirm the delivery window they're offering but it's only a yes or no choice. There is no option for a different window. There is a long hold to speak with someone and they weren't quick to respond via email. Super nice once I could talk to them.,2023-10-26T19:25:25.000Z

Delivery team  on 9/21; Installer, Jose, polite,  caring and professional; his helper Eric, wonderful. Had 3 appliances delivered on 9/21 but unfortunately the  4th item, (refrigerator) had to be delivered 9/22. Due to bad experience with other retailers in past, I called Plessers c/s and they assured me another Plessers team would make the delivery on 9/22. But that did not happen. Instead, the delivery service  pushed the refrigerator from the middle of kitchen toward wall with no floor protection as Jose and Eric did on 9/21and now I have deep zig zag grooves on my hardwood floor. Upsetting, and will be costly to repair.

I also had a wonderful experience with the gentleman who calls customers to schedule delivery and sell the warranty products. He was so genuine, funny, lighthearted and most importantly honest with me. He didn't try to sell me products that were useless, but rather educate me about the products available and allow me to make the best choice for my situation. It was a breath of fresh air especially in this day and age where every company seems to be pushing useless up sales down your throat.

She was also able to answer all of my questions about the different features and benefits of each dishwasher.I ended up purchasing from Plesser's and I am very happy with my decision.

Awful Delivery Experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If you dare buy from Plesser's, at least skip the $538.85 upcharge for “Gold Premium Inside Delivery”. The salesperson convinced me to upgrade to Gold Delivery: ""Premium in home delivery includes a 2-man team unpacking your products, bringing them into your home and placing them in the room of your choice."" The local delivery contractor was awful to work with, and only sent one person who refused to unpack or place the appliances in the room of my choice -- instead, they left them boxed and put them in one place.  I asked Plesser's to either 1) help compel the local contractor to finish the job or 2) issue a refund, but the representatives I spoke with were rude, condescending, and unwilling to help, and even threatened another delivery charge if the local company returned to finish their contracted work.       Full narrative below.I purchased Gold Insured delivery for $538.85: ""Premium in home delivery includes a 2-man team unpacking your products, bringing them into your home and placing them in the room of your choice."" My experience and the service were extremely poor and did not reflect this commitment, more resembling that of Standard Delivery, not Gold Insured. The delivery window I was provided was 4-8pm, and I made arrangements to be present during that time. The driver called at 2:30pm and said they would be there in 20 minutes, so I left my meeting right away and rushed up to the house. The driver left me waiting and did not arrive until 3:45pm anyway, so I did not need to leave my meeting nor rush. The delivery team consisted of one man who immediately declared he would only put them in one place all together – he would not take them to the room of my choice, nor unbox or inspect them. He also refused to move the appliances intended for the basement, even though one flight of stairs was to be included, and instead dropped them in the garage.  Because he was alone, he asked me to help him move each item and stabilize the dolly after the first appliance he attempted to move alone slipped and created a hole in our wall. His delivery instructions clearly read ""PGOLD SERVICE LEVEL GOLD: 1-2 PERSON DELIVERY,  UNCRATED AND INSPECTED DELIVERED INSIDE HOMETO ROOM OF CHOICE, 1 FLIGHT INCLUDED"" each part of which he ignored or fought.  The result is all our appliances (except those intended for the basement) are in one location – still boxed/crated and uninspected. I am left with a hole in our wall and to figure out how to unbox and move all these appliances, having already paid $538.85 to prevent those very problems.  Plesser's representatives were rude, condescending, and unwilling to help, and even threatened another delivery charge if the local company returned to finish their contracted work.",2023-08-28T17:54:41.000Z

1st Time & Last Time Buyer,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"To begin, I feel like pricing is a little deceiving. When I was at checkout, the ""total price"" shown was not tax included. Until I got charged, I saw a bigger number total price. I mean, at checkout, you should show the actual total price including tax. With that being said, I could just have a local company price match and pay the tax as well in stead of shipping all the way from the east coast. Regarding the delivery, I paid extra for them to bring the appliance inside the house and they should have uncrated and unwrapped for me to check before acceptance. The delivery company brought the appliance in and rushed my wife to sign. She asked them about the service we paid. They said they could unwrap it but would not take the trash away. Okay?! We have a trash can. But then they left without even uncrate it as promised in the service we paid. My wife called Plesser's and the girl said ""oh, from the picture I can see the appliance is still sitting on the crate"". She said someone or manager would call me.

It took three attempts to have the correct washer and dryer delivered. I took three days off of work and lost money. When I asked for compensation, they gave me $50 and told me I had to reach out to GE. Well no one I spoke to was rude, the entire experience was unproductive. I wanted to support a small business, instead of ordering online from Best Buy or something similar, but I was not rewarded with , the experience I had hoped for. The issue was that they didn’t deliver the machine themselves, and instead farmed it out to a delivery company in New Jersey, who was unable to help me, and who made errors, so while Plessers didn’t themselves make the mistake, they did choose to hire people who were incompetent. As I said, I did not feel I was adequately compensated for my loss of time and money. In the end, the machine works well , but I would not order from them again.",2023-08-21T20:26:27.000Z

They should have auto updates when product will take longer than ten days. Delivery dates changed three times and then delivered on the wrong date. On the bright side I understand that there is always going to be unforeseen circumstances. I gave four stars  only because they didn’t give me a more realistic time I would receive the product. ALL of the people at Plessers were very polite and understood my my concerns. I’m still waiting for my updated warranty because they issued warranty on purchase date and not on delivery date. Hope this goes well. Mark,2023-08-18T14:10:03.000Z

Its a gamble,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The original ordering was great, the salesman was very nice. After that it all went downhill. The trucking company was a major part of this horrible experience. The delivery company had our appliance in their possession for over 2 weeks, we finally received our refrigerator. I had to email and ask questions on how much longer it would take. I was never able to speak to a manager. After making 6 phone calls and waiting on the phone for over 4 hours in total over the 6 phone calls, I was told that I could drive down to Ohio and pick up the appliance myself. Then I was reached by 3 methods, email, text message and phone call. At which time I was told the appliance would arrive on a Saturday. I replied to all three methods of contact that my family was out of town that weekend and we cannot accept the delivery. I have a email confirming that they will reschedule. That following Saturday I received a phone call from the delivery company that they were at my house and needed me to open my garage. After I turned them away I had to make several phone calls in order to get a new date. Finally the appliance was being delivered on a Friday. When the shipment arrived, it was damaged. Scratches and dents, the back of the unit was severely damaged to where I had to bend the metal back in place. After talking with someone on the phone from the delivery company, I was told I could reject it or wait for the following day when Plessers was open and I would receive a significant discount. When calling Plessers to discuss my damaged appliance. The lady was not helpful and rude to me and my wife. When I sent the serial number to her and told her the damaged unit does sound fairly loud, her response was ""well because you are using this we cannot take it back."" At which time I told her that the delivery company put the refrigerator in place and they plugged it in. We were not using it at all. Then she became insulting and you could even hear her giggling/laughing when my wife expressed her disgust with this whole experience. We then were told we could be credited for $300 (the cost of the extended warranty that we purchased). After rejecting that offer we then were told $375 was the highest we could receive. After checking around for this discontinued refrigerator, I was able to find another one from a different company. But we decided to take the low ball credit and not risk the possibility of waiting another 3+ weeks to receive another appliance that may be damaged as well. Overall we were not happy with this experience and would not take this risk again in the near future.",2023-08-16T12:16:28.000Z

Despite my best efforts to obtain a…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Despite my best efforts to obtain a reasonable delivery date or timeframe at the time of purchase, the date that the dishwasher was ultimately delivered was unreasonable and violated every assurance I received from Plessers that it would be delivered timely. The nature of Plesser's business is not beyond the realm of understanding. Asking for a timeframe when delivery could be made should result in a reasonable estimate. Plesser's failure to provide a reasonable delivery estimate evidences: (i) they have no idea what they are doing; or (2) they purposefully and fraudulently misrepresent estimated delivery dates in furtherance of finalizing a sale. I suspect its the latter. Moreover, I requested on multiple occasions for someone at Plessers to contact me and they have yet to respond. As a result of this experience with Plessers, I do not plan to purchase anything else from this company and suggest fellow consumers to look elsewhere.",2023-08-10T20:58:03.000Z

Overcharging on Sales Tax,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a newer model Bosch dishwasher. I talked to a salesperson and she told me about an 800 series dishwasher that she'd sell me at a discount.  I said yes and then she said that dishwasher wasn't available. I asked about another model and we talked price, delivery and extended warranty which she included my invoice.  I live in MA and asked if they sell to MA customers which she said yes. She asked how many steps to get where the kitchen is.  I've never had a delivery count the steps up to my house.  Delivery is delivery in MA.  I had to pay extra for a few steps.  I gave my credit card number and asked what the total amount would be. She said they'd send me the invoice.  I've never bought anything w/o knowing the total amount before hand. When I finally got the invoice, they incorrectly charged MA sales tax on the delivery and extended warranty.  I had to call accounting to clear things up.  There was $50 rebate on delivery and she said she'd give me a $50 credit instantly so I wouldn't have to wait the 12 weeks for a rebate.  I had to ask multiple times for the $50. It was a huge headache buying from Plesser's.  In the end the salesperson made good but I had to keep at her.  Never again will I buy from Plesser's.",2023-07-25T21:33:13.000Z

We had their repair guys out who told us they’d come back in a month to test it in then in a month that they’d have a part in a couple months. I couldn’t get anywhere with Kitchenaid but Plessers kept working on their end to get us a replacement, and we are finally getting a new fridge thanks to Jill!! I’m shocked at Kitchenaid, we won’t ever purchase from them again but we will from Plessers!",2023-06-21T15:20:05.000Z
10 Yr Warranty is a Sham,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Plessers is good till you have to use the sham warranty. They have you believing you are covered for 10 years.  I purchased $20K Cafe appliances thinking i had a warranty for 10 years as i was led to believe.  I call for service and they tell me the warranty only covers 1 component.  I then have to pay for the installation. What a farce. Stick with Home Depot or Lowes where they have real extended warranty and everything is covered.,2023-06-20T22:48:33.000Z

I then allowed you to bid on the remaining $40k of appliances. You were not competitive at all.  When the sales associate spoke to the sales manager he said no on working out a volume price.  I then went to PC Richards, and Appliance world, where appliance world worked with me on install and delivery price and a small discount. In addition your install and delivery staff are high end delivery people. They delivered the frig and it was obvious they wanted to leave ASAP to their next delivery.  Not impressive for a high end appliance store. On the other hand Appliance world has a dedicated staff that only installs. They solved problems on the spot and I was their only stop for the day. After experiencing both, I would say Plessers is well behind Appliance World in price and installation.",2023-06-20T18:18:41.000Z
Totally Dissatisfied,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We called the evening of 5/10 to place an order for a dishwasher and spoke with Jenn. We called back to order it after I talked the options over with my wife but Jenn texted us back saying she was on another call but would call us before she left. She did not and never responded to our follow-up texts. I called the next day and placed the order with Peter Romano who was very nice and helpful. He told me I would get an email the night before with a delivery window. I then got an email from Plessers saying I would get a call the night before with my window. The morning of the delivery, I woke up to my wife panicking about the delivery people being at our home. I had only recived an email about the delivery 20 minutes before it arrived. Obviuously, this was not enough notice and luckily the deliverymen were nice enough to take their time unloading to allow me time to disconnect the old unit. I called Peter twice about this delivery issue and never got a call back. We used Plesser's based on a recommendation from a family member but after this we will be sure to never use Plesser's again and will be sure to tell all of our friends and family to do the same.

GE Stove from NY to San Diego Border,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I worked with Michael Erhart and couldn’t have had a better experience. A pure professional. I needed to get a new GE stove from NY to the San Diego/Mexico Border in very short order and Michael made that happen. Upon reviewing my invoice a few days after ordering I saw I had been charged a $25 “convenience fee” for using a credit card to make the purchase. While speaking with someone else about when the item would ship - I mentioned that I wasn’t aware of that fee and he said he’d pass that info along to Michael. A few hours later I got an email from Michael saying the fee has been waived. And the stove arrived in San Diego as predicted. It is now being installed somewhere deep in the Baja and I couldn’t be happier. Thanks Michael for your awesome service - give the man a raise!!,2023-06-09T03:00:17.000Z

Plessers does not have a return Policy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I recently started a Kitchen remodeling project, we purchase over $15K of appliances from Plessers including a 30 Inch Wolf Dual Fuel Range and Oven. Because of a changes in the design of the kitchen the opening for the Range is 36"" inches. I called Plessers requesting a return of the 30"" inch (which is still in the box on the pallet in my garage) and I would purchase the 36"" inch Wolf from Plessers as a replacement. The larger Wolf Range is $4K more expensive then the 30"" inch. When we called our Sales Representative (Mario) he informed us that Plessers policy is that they cannot take back high end appliances as they are considered a special order. This was never communicated to us when we purchased the range, I have escalated to the owners and received a call from the Sales Manger two days ago with no update on the status of returning the 30"" and purchasing a 36"" inch.  On the Plessers's website the continually tout a ""family owned business"" that provides ""Old Fashioned Customer Service"",  based on the return policy and run-around we are now going through, this is not a true statement.",2023-05-25T16:06:28.000Z
Defective product and bad service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The washer/dryer came without packaging. We found a big obvious dent and a couple of small dents on front of the machine. We stopped the person doing installation and show them the damage of the machine. We paid $249.99 for installation. He asked me whether accept some money for the damage. I told him I prefer a brand new one without any damage. He said he can ask GE technician come to change the front door so that i don’t have to wait for using. He didn’t tell me if I use the machine I will not have chance to change a new one. Anyway I agreed. A couple of days later, I received the appointment for changing the door. I asked excuse from my work staying at home for the service. The guy came and asked me if I have a broken TV. I was surprised ask him “are you sure it is TV?”. He said “yes”. I said: “no, I am waiting for changing the door of washer/Dryer. He checked the paper in his hand and showed me: “yes, it is washer/Dryer”. I did not feel the right person for changing the door because he didn’t bring anything. He came in taking some pictures of the machine. During the conversation I asked him a couple of questions about the machine. I asked is there any program for “only spinning”? I occasionally only use spinning for hand washing clothes. He told me “no “only spinning” program. You have to choose “Delicates” program instead of hand washing”. Later I checked the website I found the program for only spinning. I feel very uncomfortable for the service. First, I was told the person will change the door, (one time service) it wasn’t. Second, I was told I need another service for changing the door. I realized if the person like him careless and unprofessional to change the door, I may need more services. I don’t have time for handling the problem. I called pleaser’s asking for changing the new machine. I was told I don’t have chance for changing new one because I have used it. I don’t feel comfortable with it.

"John DeSenso was great, A+.  Delivery service company, not so good.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"We were very pleased with John DeSenso assistance when purchasing our Bosch dishwasher.  We already knew the model we wanted but local stores were out of stock and said it was severely back-ordered and would be weeks or months of waiting--maybe just a ploy to persuade us to buy from on-hand inventory.  So, searched the internet and found the DW at Plesser's. John was product knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable making a large dollar purchase over the phone.While John's experience was very good, we were not impressed with the delivery company, AM Home Delivery.  To start, rather then contact me in advance to coordinate a delivery schedule, on Apr 20 (afternoon), they sent an email & text advising delivery was the next day, Apr 21, between 11 AM and 3 PM. Unfortunately, I had an appointment during that time and would not be available. I immediately called AM to reschedule the delivery. Their first response was something like a warning that if I delayed delivery too long, they would charge storage fees. Then they said next delivery would be Apr 27 or 28.  Geez, I thought, I should be charging them. I think I got them to commit to Apr 26.  Imagine my surprise on the 21st, about 11:30 AM, I receive call from the AM driver. OMG, he was at my house attempting to deliver. I told him the delivery had been rescheduled for the next week. At this point, I had lost most confidence/trust with AM so I reached out to John at Plesser's. I explained my experience with AM and asked if there was anyway he could help expedite the order. And, apparently, he was able to speed up the delivery to the 25th.  So, a BIG YEA for John. At delivery, the DW shipping container was to be opened to inspect for damage. But the driver (nice guy) simply put the DW in the garage and started to leave. I stopped him and asked him to wait while I opened it. My thoughts are AM lacks customer service skills, is inefficient and cuts corners.  A+ for John but a D for AM Home Delivery.",2023-05-13T22:38:34.000Z

The store pressured me to take the delivery and the delivery company a.m. delivery is very unprofessional and rude as well as charging me for a certificate of insurance to make the delivery. Never had this experience with any of your competitors which delivered much better service. If you didn’t have the refrigerator I wanted it in stock. I would not have purchased anything from your store.My impression is the sales staff conducted themselves as used car salesmen.

So I missed the first pick up day and the stuff sat there for a few more days. It took me about 90 minutes to do it, and I have a bad back. I was not very happy and I had tipped them generously. They could have been more accommodating. What can you do?",2023-04-19T20:27:33.000Z
We bought 4 appliances from Plessers,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"We bought 4 appliances from Plessers. The stove came damaged in the side but we decided since no one would be seeing it we would deal with it. The refrigerator… that’s another story. The first one came with dents all over the doors. The second one came and we sent it right back because it also had dents. The third one was delivered and this one had a broken gasket. Now a month later still trying to get what we paid for, a brand new fridge. I don’t understand how hard is it to get a damage free fridge when your paying this kind of money. Plessers customer service was great at first but now I have fridge doors that were delivered to me with no explanation and no phone call from Plessers. Very unhappy.",2023-04-19T14:01:03.000Z

YIKES,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"YIKES! I went with Plessers because the price was the best, but they need to work out the issues, with the installation service they use for Southern California.  The person who scheduled my installation was seriously untrained.  She started by not giving me the option to have the refrigerator installed  and old one removed (despite the fact the sales person instructed me to make these arrangements with them) and instructed me to call Plesser's again who basically just turned me back to her again.  I ended up calling them back and got the same girl.  This time she ended up quoting me the wrong prices (10 times as much as anyone else) to take the old fridge away and to install the new fridge with the water connector.  I was at a point I was going to cancel this completely until she called me back to apologize for the mistake.  But then she got confused again and told me that I would get a new delivery date.  As it turned out, the old one was never cancelled and I got 20 minutes notice they were coming.  Add to that, the fridge had a dent in it and the door replacement is on back order and even that took a host of phone calls from LG, to Plesser's Cust Service and to the shipping company to get this taken care of.  Way too much of my life spent on this to ever deal with them again.  But who knows how long before I even hear back from anyone regarding the new door.  I will definitely stick to local places like Best Buy in the future.",2023-04-04T22:13:15.000Z

Thermador Kitchen,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"This order for a complete Thermador kitchen ensemble was not my first experience with Plessers, and if I ever need another appliance, it won’t be my last.  Dealing with the Covid crisis was difficult for everyone, Plessers included, so I will not include any circumstance surrounding that event in my review.  The people at Plessers are knowledgeable professionals, and are willing to help you decide what to buy based on facts, not personal preferences.  What appeals to you may not appeal to me, so I like their recommendations style.  In addition, my new kitchen was in the 40K range and I saved paying sales taxes on this purchase.  That’s a lot of money saved.  Delivery and condition of items upon delivery have always been just what you would expect and want.  Just purchase one item from them and you will see exactly what I am talking about.  They say what they mean and mean what they say.  If you can’t tell by now, I really like dealing with this company.",2023-03-10T20:37:14.000Z

Terrible experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The showroom experience was great and the reason why we chose Plessers for our new range. Unfortunately the delivery and subsequent interactions with Plessers went downhill from there. The first time the range was delivered, they said that it would not fit in the space even after they measured it. They did not bother to even try. I requested for them to come a second time and I was asked multiple times if the space was the correct measurement which we had confirmed multiple times. The second time they came, they asked if we did anything to increase the space and I said again, no it will fit. Sure enough, it fit - and with a little room. They then pushed the range in with force and as we found out after they left, caused a gas leak. We had to get our gas company to come and fix it. Extremely disappointed at how it was handled and there was no follow up whatsoever. We also asked for some sort of a discount or refund and that was completely ignored. Will not be going back to Plessers.",2023-03-09T17:43:35.000Z

I will never shop at another appliance store,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I had such a wonderful experience at Plesser's Appliances in Babylon.  From the minute I walked in, I knew I was in the right place and I will never shop anywhere else for appliances. Even though it was close to closing time I was greeted with a friendly and professional attitude. The showroom is beautiful and the whole experience was pleasant and positive. Eric, the salesman who helped me was extremely knowledgable. I was working with a limited budget (but I have expensive taste) and he was able to give me a great price on much higher level products, than I ever expected to be able to afford. He was able to explain the difference in brands, models and wasn't pushy at all. He was patient and didn't seem bothered at all at my indecisiveness, questions or the fact that he continued to work with me past closing time.  This is the first time I have made an expensive purchase for my home without my ex husband and I was nervous. Thankfully I chose the perfect place and it was a positive experience with not one complaint. Compared to other large chain appliance stores, Plessers is a thousand times better with much more knowledgable staff, options and cost too. They were willing to match the price the other store had offered but I ended up getting way better quality that was still was in my budget. I would recommend Plesser's Appliances and definitely Eric to anyone.",2023-03-01T05:14:07.000Z

"Great Prices, Amazing Customer Service",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I needed a full suite of kitchen appliances but was finding that many appliances we were looking at were back ordered or unavailable. Then I found Plessers Appliances while doing research and I am really happy I did. Not only did they have most everything I needed in stock, but they beat everyone else's prices by a significant amount. And that was before Plesser's own rebates were applied. They also included a free extended warranty. Amazing!So, pricing and availability are one thing but what about customer service. All I can say is WOW!  Jennifer O'Brien handled my entire order which involved many recalls and questions on my part, and she was fabulous. Friendly, very responsive and I could go on. This was definitely the best online purchase I can remember. I highly recommend Plessers Appliances.",2023-02-22T22:42:19.000Z

48 inch Refrigerator,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,the price of the refrigerator was very good  but AM Home Delivery gets to bend you over when it arrives  Why a long established company like Plessers outsources all of their deliveries to this company makes me question their judgement  AM Home Delivery is where the profit lies so maybe Plessers owns them and that would explain the relationship,2023-02-22T01:20:00.000Z

Peter Romano. Great experience,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,In 2019 we visited Plessers and met Peter Romano who was very helpful in assisting us in all new appliances for our kitchen (except our DCS 36” gas oven) He was very knowledgeable regarding the differences in brands and details each appliance offered.  In January we called Peter and left a message for him to call us back because we were now interested in replacing that oven. He called us back right away. (Which is surprising since no one calls you back anymore). When we went in the show room there were many 36” gas ovens on display. Again Peter told us the pros and cons of each product. I went home and researched each product and the reviews basically stated the same as what Peter said.  Everyone at Plessers were friendly and helpful.  After our purchase today Stephanie helped with the invoice.  She is always running around with a smile on and trying to make everyone’s experience more pleasurable.  Definitely the place to go for customer service!!,2023-02-18T22:24:42.000Z

Just be honest,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I had a good experience. Mario was great to work with. However, I felt a little deceived by the sales advertisement stating that the sale was ending. I specifically asked if the sale would continue next week and was told No by Eugene himself. I hurriedly made a decision so I could get the sale price only to see that the sale continued on to the next week. My experience went downhill from there as I wanted to upgrade to a different model but it was out of stock and then I was going to have to pay a restocking fee so I was forced to buy a different refrigerator and spend more than I really could afford.

While waiting for another dryer, the salesperson called to say there was only one Samsung gas dryer that would vent on the dryer’s left side which is what I needed so I had to change to Samsung. She called several times to determine the side. I repeatedly said the dryer’s left side but looking at it from the front it is the right side which was the criteria she kept going by. When the Samsung arrived, not only was it vented on the wrong side, but it was dented. I asked for a refund and purchased from another appliance dealer. Unacceptable.",2023-02-16T00:33:56.000Z

Just added to the frustration of backordered appliances. and BTW- Plessers charged the whole amount even though they knew it was going to be several months before shipment.

Purchased a gas stove,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a gas stove, on 11/29/2022. Paid for delivery and installation. Installers left after they turned the stove on to burn off shipping coating. Within minutes there was a glow from under the bottom plate. We called the store and were told that was normal. Shortly after that call we saw a flame coming from under the bottom plate. Called again and were told it was normal. Told them it was packing cardboard that had not been removed by installers. We called the salesman who had sold it to us, he was not available. Very disappointed that we never received a callback. Not only did we pay for installation, that was done improperly, but we now have a brand new stove with a burn spot. Not at all happy, will not be shopping there again.",2023-01-12T17:31:22.000Z

I researched a Bosch dishwasher model and needless to say that it was on back order everywhere. I was given a 20-24 month timeframe from a local store and was told to pick another brand from another local store.   This led me to the internet. During my search I came across Plessers that also showed this specific model. Called Plessers and got connected with Dave. It was not in stock but decided to order online anyway as his estimate was 10-12 weeks.  To my surprise it was delivered to my house in 3 weeks. Communication was great, was updated via email every single step in the order/delivery process.  Thank you, Plessers....absolutely great experience.",2023-01-06T18:02:24.000Z

The Best,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"By far, the best experience from beginning to end!  I was hesitant purchasing because of living in a different state but it didn’t take long to put those fears aside. We purchased a complete appliance package for a whole home renovation. The renovation is now 15 months and hopeful to be completed by February 2023. Plesser’s communicated and assured us they understand construction delays and will hold our order. Hard to believe but they held our order for 6 months. We today’s work Friday gave them a 3 week “heads up” that we were ready to receive the appliances and they shipped within 3 days, sent us a link to track the progress of the voyage from NY to FL and everything arrived timely. Thank you Plesser’s, you are the bright spot in our renovation project. I have shared your information many times",2022-12-16T12:14:59.000Z
Dishonest sales person,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Dishonest sales person. Horrible communication. I would never use Plessers again. I ordered a dishwasher from them. Was told that the dishwasher was a price that was actually higher than was listed on website. I was given an additional discount and a rebate. But when the bill came there was a credit card fee and additional delivery charges that absolutely weren’t included in online purchases. I left several messages and an email. Eric didn’t return any of my calls. And the dishwasher came a week late.  So swindled and unhappy.,2022-12-16T05:25:56.000Z

Great Selection and Customer Service!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's had the discontinued range we had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find at any other location that shipped nationwide.  We'd ordered one at another large online appliance retailer almost a year ago and were still waiting to have it shipped to us, and despite checking in periodically we were not notified that the item had been discontinued.Ordering from Plesser's was straightforward and simple - thank you so much Daran for your friendly and prompt assistance!  Next time I will look here first!After having our range delivered, we discovered some minor cosmetic damage to the unit.  The shipping box had been in great condition, so we're thinking it must have happened during manufacturing/packaging, and neither the store nor the shipper would have been able to tell.  Having waited so long for our range we decided to accept the unit, and our shipper sent pictures to Plessers and said someone would contact us with options.  Our Plessers customer support associate Nyra offered us several options, and ended up giving us both a discount on the unit and called GE for us to have the damaged areas replaced at no cost to us.

I would give them 0 stars if possible,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would give them 0 stars if possible. Ordered my appliances in June when they were all in stock. When it came time for delivery “suddenly” my oven was no longer in stock.I suspect it was sold to someone else but I can’t prove that. I am still waiting. Manufacturer notified me(not Plessers) it was back in stock 3 weeks ago and I still don’t have it. Plessers told me it “didn’t make the truck”! In addition salesman added a $248 charge for using my credit card and “forgot” to mention it. They did remove it after I caught it. Every time I called someone would “check on my problem and get back to me which they never did. I wouldn’t buy ANYTHING ever again from these people! Dealing with them was a NIGHTMARE!

His ongoing work through my contractor and consistent follow-up calls were seamless making you our home remodel appliance-go-to.

Plessers is the best!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I’ve just finished with my third appliance transaction at Plessers and I am beyond happy with them every time. First purchase was an outdoor tv (purchased 14 years ago and it still works!) 2nd purchase was a Bosch dishwasher (2yrs ago and still works quieter than a mouse) and now my 3rd and biggest, a Frigidaire Professional refrigerator (36” standard size).The Price for the fridge could not be beat and the customer service was outstanding. The sales floor assistance (Mario) was beyond helpful, all questions answered and excellent guidance in choosing the best model for me. He was very clear in explaining the difference between each manufacturer’s lines of fridge models as well as accessories that come with each model. After purchase, I researched and found out that they gave me a better deal on the warranty than PC Richards (10 yr on some parts for free and 5 yr service for everything at $299)Installers were fantastic! They showed up on time and were in and out with no issues. They were very careful with removal of old fridge and installation of the new one. They unboxed the new one outside of my house and removed all garbage. They checked the water line twice for leaks and helped me with flushing the line for the first use (fridge has water dispenser.) They leveled the doors, which were a smidgen uneven at arrival. They were very polite and helpful in answering any questions I had…and I was a bit neurotic with examining the fridge so I thank them for dealing with me.

Great Experience,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I don’t typically write reviews unless the experience is terrible, but this is the exact opposite.  Plesser’s was great during the entire process.  We ordered an oven from a different company in April and the website said delivery would be early June.  When that deadline came and went and I kept asking for an ETA, they kept saying “a couple more weeks”.  Our kitchen install date was rapidly approaching and I stumbled upon Plesser’s website as having the oven “arriving soon”.  When I called them asking for an ETA of when it could be arriving they gave an honest answer (4-5 weeks).  It was also cheaper than the other place, plus their warranty is better so I placed the order. The timeline proved to be accurate and when it arrived at their warehouse they called me to confirm it was the correct item and explained the delivery process.  Overall, it was a positive experience and I would definitely recommend plessers.",2022-10-19T12:41:07.000Z

I had to climb up a ladder (I am 76 years old) to turn off the valve, then turn off the ice maker in the fridge.  the next team spent about 20 minutes fixing the problem at the back of the fridge.

I purchased a NEW appliance package…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a NEW appliance Frigidaire package from Plesser's Appliance in Babylon.  WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE. The stove and fridge both arrived damaged, they replaced the fridge with a dented fridge & sent a tech to inspect the range which appears to be bent??? because the bottom draw sticks out on one side by a 1/2 inch and in a 1/4 on the other side.  After a 2 week wait they sent the tech with a panel and NOT a new draw and guess what, same results!!!  You see, the panel holds the draw front to the actual draw. I guess this was Frigidaire's way of trying to save a buck.  I was told by Plesser's on every call with customer service that a new draw would be delivered.  Even the 1st techs that inspected the stove said the same thing, the draw is bent or the entire stove body is bent. I called to complain and can't even reach customer service.Now I'm left with the choice of trying to have the stove replaced where most likely the new wood floors that were just finished getting damaged by sliding the stove out. Plesser's delivery department does not use hand trucks with inflated wheel's, the use the hand trucks with rock solid wheels.Trust me, shop elsewhere.Part 2. Today, 9/29/22, I updated my original review (corrected grammar) and added my concern that any new delivery would damage my new floors in my newly constructed home.  As most of us are aware the cost of just about everything is extremely high, construction costs are astronomical.  Prior to making those corrections and adding my concern to the original review, Jill from Plesser's customer care called me to set up the exchange for another stove, I agreed, but not happy about it, that I have to have the plumber back to unhook the damaged stove than re-hook the new one at my expense and take the chance of damaging the floors which I would have to cover at my expense as well, delivery was set for 10/5/22. OK.  A few hours later I received a call from Dan from Plesser's customer care to let me know that they are no longer replacing with a new stove and will only offer a refund for the damaged stove due to this negative review that they feel is misleading.  Per Dan, they did reach out to me, which is true after I called them 3 times on the 28th and left messages, between 2pm & 5pm.  They responded via email 7:28pm for me to call customer care between 8am - 5pm.  That was the 1st response until Jill called me this morning.Nothing stated in the original review is misleading, it is how the events unfolded.  I even told Jill (who is very nice by the way) that I would remove this negative review as long as the new stove was delivered undamaged.  I also let her know that if the new one happens to come damaged I would be forced to leave another negative review.  Please be aware that the replacement stove would have been the 3rd stove they delivered, the 1st was so badly damaged on all sides, it looked like it fell off of a building!  She told me that I was not being accommodating and no matter what they did I would not be happy?? and should request a refund and shop elsewhere. A NEW/UNDAMAGED stove would've put a smile on my face :)!! You know, the one I gave Plesser's a lot of money for.So I was basically told by Dan from Plesser's customer care that in order to receive the new stove that I should remove or correct??? my original review, I'm assuming to Plesser's upper managements liking as he mentioned the decision came from them to not replace the DAMAGED stove they delivered.  Per Dan (whom is also very pleasant to speak with), this issue was resolved and there was no reason to correct or add anything to the original review. Nothing was resolved, a resolution was offered which I begrudgingly accepted.  When a NEW/UNDAMAGED stove is delivered that's when the issue is resolved.  If the issue was resolved, there would not have been a negative review in the 1st place.I am astounded & amazed that Plesser's Appliances would treat a customer this way over any type of review, positive or negative.",2022-09-29T22:23:19.000Z

Disappointing to say the least,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"My salesperson at Plessers made the initial experience easy. I bragged about how wonderful Plessers was based on my purchasing experience was. However, three of the items, after being guaranteed and paid for, had issues. One out of stock with no backorder date, one damaged en route to the warehouse, and one damaged upon arrival to my home. Inventory is extremely low and all three items were unable to be replaced in a reasonable time. While I understand inventory from the manufacturer may be out of Plessers' control, their inability to fairly compensate monetarily and lack of customer service was beyond disappointing. Needless to say, I was able to find two of the items locally in stock and ready to deliver. Unfortunately, I will think twice before using or recommending Plessers to family and friends.",2022-09-14T22:08:10.000Z

I had been duped by another company previously, they said they had two in stock and as soon as my order was processed all of a sudden it was backordered with no idea of when it would come in. I was definitely gun shy about placing another order only to have the same thing happen but Eugune asked me to call him, said he was holding the dishwasher for me, and I told him about my experience prior and why I was so hesitant. He told me, trust me, after you deal with Plessers you will be going online to give us a 5 star review - he couldn't have been more right! Everything from placing my order, to updates nearly daily regarding delivery status was completely professional, I am truly impressed. In this day and age it seems that the big box stores really don't care about their customers, but I got the impression that Plessers definitely does. I even got a call from the gentleman in the warehouse confirming all the details down to model number/color prior to having the trucking company pick it up, and he was so pleasant!

Perfect Transaction,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Although I started out hesitant to do business with an East Coast company all the way from California…. I'm glad I did. The range that I was most interested in was available only from Plesser's at the time... Also happened to be the lowest price I could find. My concern was is this company as good as they say they are? Would it be shipped without damage even though it would be trucked so far a distance and there was no shipping charge…? My concerns were put to rest when the range arrived in perfect condition, looks and operates beautifully.  I did purchase a 5 year extended warranty that has not yet been tested with the in house offer of Plesser's. Would I purchase from Plesser's again?YES —DEFINITELY!",2022-09-01T22:19:55.000Z

Great Purchase,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refrigerator and matching freezer in August 2020. I did lots of research first. All the big fridges and freezers get bad reviews across the board; high end and not. But I really loved the look so I went with this set because Frigidaire is a brand I trust and it was a new model. I was hoping they finally got it right. They did! I've waited over a year to be sure but I haven't had a single issue since the day I got them. The only thing I loved better was doing business with Plesser. Their prices can't be beat; they're knowledgeable, professional and very patient. Though it took 6 months from purchase to delivery because of Covid, this was a great experience. I never get tired of walking into my newly renovated kitchen.",2022-09-01T14:26:08.000Z

Nothing is explained to you about how the delivery works.  Had I known it would have only been brought into my kitchen, I would have had them leave it and my husband could have brought it in. They suck you in and take your money.  Total rip off.  BUYER BEWARE!  Very poor customer service.

We were even willing to take a restocking hit, but surprisingly they were not as interested in good customer care after the sale.  They were oh so helpful to get that sale.  I was singing the praises of Plessers.  Whatever you do, DO NOT, open the box… apparently that’s the “we will not accept” red flag.  But of course they want you to open it to inspect on delivery - go figure - a perfect system to not accept returns.  So according to them, I guess I will try to off load this beautiful stove on eBay - no way I can get 240 to my stove area.  Buy ONLY if there is no chance for a return - some things are better to buy locally…",2022-08-16T17:54:05.000Z

My experience over the years with those stores is really horrible. They get your order/get your money/and then forget you exist after the sales transaction.

Plesser's staff ARE THE NICEST AND MOST HELPFUL PEOPLE  you will ever speak to. We ordered the dishwasher and planned delivery. Their staff followed through with us on every aspect from sales to installation to service. When we had an issue with a defective gasket trim, their customer service agent ordered a new part and their appliance support staff came and repaired the issue.

A very accommodating and pleasant company,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"My initial review of Plesser's was submitted when I first purchased my new kitchen appliances. I had an excellent experience with the company and especially with my salesperson, Lindsey Coughlin. Plesser's had accommodated my need to have the appliances initially delivered to my storage unit (about 5 minutes from my home) while my kitchen was being renovated. I'm writing this review as a follow-up to say that six weeks later, when I was ready to have the appliances brought to my home, Plesser's arranged to have them picked up from the storage unit and delivered to my house without any issues. I felt that they went the extra mile to help me with this. I found everyone who worked for Plesser's to be friendly and customer-focused.",2022-07-26T01:29:25.000Z
NOT HAPPY!!!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We were remodeling our kitchen and was recommended to try Plesser’s. My wife placed an order on 2/8/2022 for a Thermador refrigerator, stove/oven and dishwasher. There was a promotion where we could receive a free range hood or microwave. We chose the range hood.The order was placed with our salesperson Eric and paid for that day. In March, our contractor discovered that Eric had placed the wrong part number for the hood and had to be reordered.We have received all of the product with the exception of the hood. Here is my problem, when a customer spends almost $14,000 on product you would expect their representatives would keep you updated on the status of your order. I have called numerous times to receive an update. Same response, we’ll get back to you.6 months to the date of our order July 8th, I was put in contact with Jasmine in order tracking. I explain the situation again and my frustration with Plesser’s to provide answers as to when we may expect our range hood. She assured me she would inquire and get back to me with an answer.On July 12th I called back as Jasmine never returned my call. Here we go again, retell my story for about the tenth time. I spoke to a gentleman named Peter. I wanted to speak to the general manager. Peter advised me he wasn’t readily available and how could he help. Story retold again. To Peter’s credit he did get back to in 2 days after speaking to Thermador. Thermador is experiencing the same issues as numerous companies with respect to supply issues. Our hood isn’t expected in until October or November. Could we have had earlier had not Eric transpose the part number? I was told we were 1 of 8 customers that had this on order. My question to them, am I #1, 3,4? No response until Peter said we would be next.In summary, as a former salesperson communication is important. I feel that they received my payment and oh well…..I should have gone to PC Richard’s",2022-07-26T01:07:25.000Z

She met prices from competitors and also was cheaper for some. We explained our timeline, and when we weren’t ready, Plesser’s gladly held everything until we were ready. Emily updated us regularly and always returned my phone calls promptly when we had a question. The delivery and installation went just as smoothly as the purchase.

First time customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"First time customer, and I will not buy from Plesser's again.Lack of communication/incompetence. Let me explain: I specifically asked a Plesser's representative if delivery can be delayed because we are going to be on vacation. She said they will contact me to schedule delivery PRIOR to showing up. Not true! I received a text message while we were on vacation that my range would be delivered the following day. I did NOT confirm the delivery (they provided a link to click on to confirm). Instead, I called Plesser's to cancel it/reschedule. I spoke to Mara who put me on hold while she (supposedly) called to cancel the delivery for the following day. When I asked for proof of cancellation she said she would call me by the end of the day as soon as she heard from them. No phone call, no email. Instead, I got a text message the following day that the delivery was on the way. Then, a phone call (I could not answer as we were on the plane) letting me know that they are at my address and I am not there, and that they can only wait 15 minutes for me. So, total lack of communication. By the way .... the person I spoke to at Plesser's was Mara.",2022-06-30T23:01:39.000Z

Customer service said she would have someone call me.  I've called 3 times since then (3 weeks ago) and still no response.

The Samsung Oven/Microwave has a 1 year manufacturer warranty from the date of purchase.  So I lost not only approx. 2 months coverage.  What tops this off is upon registering the product with Samsung this website states my warranty as expiring in November 2022.  This would provide me with 5 months manufacturer warranty.

Having that said, being that we utilized this individuals service we went ahead and followed him at his new employer. He provided his input in regards to what exactly we were looking for and everything met our needs. However, their service delivery was incredibly poor. Upon arrival the two installers were already in disagreement with each other. Not only that an extra part was needed since the appliances didn’t fit correctly. Instead of providing options or fulfilling the services which we additionally paid for, we had to figure out on our own what was needed. The response from one of the installers was “… you can buy at Home Depot.” We called the individual that assisted us in this purchase and in short stated there was nothing he can do. So now, we made a purchase of over $2,000 not including services for installation to have them sit unused in the basement. How disgruntled would you be?",2022-06-13T20:18:29.000Z

You took $10,000 of my money in February telling me my appliances would be delivered at the end of March early April. You emailed me, rather than called me, in April to tell me that my appliances would not be in until early May. Again in May, you emailed me and computer called me to tell me my appliances would not be in until June. Remember you were still holding my $10,000 that I could have been earning some kind of interest on. I received another email and computer generated call in June telling me my appliances would not be here until August and that was the earliest date that I could receive it. You have $10,000, full payment, for these appliances and still no personal contact or any true delivery date. I understand that there are supply chain issues, but taking more than a fair down payment and giving me no options about future delivery dates seems like a scam. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed being my brother who had purchased from you before spoke so highly of your business practices.

So I called to put the order in for the installation. Now it appeared to be too late.  Then I got word the truck had broken down and the delivery could not be made on that day. The folks in the office did not seem to know what the other was doing. Everyone in that company seemed very confused about what was going on. It cost me time and money, to be honest.  I had to get someone else to install it, very costly!  That work got screwed up as they did not take haul the old stove away.  Now I had to call a different service for the hauling.This project cost me just around $2K.  Next time, I will probably use Home Depot, which would include the entire package.

They were the only one I found who would deliver a refrigerator into the home, during Covid. Since that time, I've experienced ice crystals in my Frigedaire Professional freezer. They wanted me to take several troubleshooting steps before they would call a repairman. Luckily, it corrected itself. Today, 15 months later, I'm replacing the compressor. I did not buy an extended warranty, so I am in the hole for the bill and for the amount of groceries I threw away. In addition, there are tiny dint-like impressions on the doors. Plessers is in NY and I'm in TN. I guess they picked the worst item and shipped it here, bc they would never see me again. I will not do business with Plessers again. Don't get me started on Frigidaire. Terrible customer service.",2022-06-01T16:10:01.000Z
Do I qualify for this rebate??,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Trying to capitalize on rebates and the salesperson wasn't even sure what was what and the deadline loomed.  Still not sure if I was led astray on how to get my rebates.  I didn't get the best one because of the lack of followup.  She also had to push it through in order to get certain benefits which meant she ended ordering a part we didn't even need and we have to pay shipping to return it which is more than 1/2 the cost of the item! Just simple things of being rushed.,2022-06-01T05:26:12.000Z

Plessers solution is to refer us to their service company who by the way does not stock ANY parts.  Service company will visit us, try to diagnose and then return with parts. This will be a month long process at best.UPDATE Spoke to builder today. This same model Viking DW was ordered from PC Richard s. When installed it did not work either.

Design flaw!,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"26 May 2022. We have had this appliance since Dec 2019. Up until now it has been wonderful. Six days ago a serious design flaw exposed itself. We were boiling water in a pasta pot on the back left element.  A small amount of water bubbled out the joint between the two pots and some went down the back vents. If you have ever heard that sickening noise of water hitting electronics you know what happened. The two left elements stopped working almost immediately. The right two elements stopped working two days later. We called GE and they said “out of warranty find someone local”.

"Plesser’s great, Delivery Company STINKS!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"The service from Eric Cullen was great. The refrigerator is beautiful and a dream so far, we love it. The delivery service from AM Transportation Logistics Inc. was TERRIBLE! We paid for the SERVICE LEVEL GOLD: 1-2 PERSON DELIVERY, UNCRATED AND INSPECTED DELIVERED INSIDE HOME TO ROOM OF CHOICE, 1 FLIGHT INCLUDED for and extra 75.00. We paid for this service so we could open the package to check for damage before they left. We live in a complex that has a receiving dock where they inspect the product for us. We were not asking them to deliver it to our room and install it, just to unpack it at the receiving dock. The driver who called to tell us he was coming spoke perfect English but when he got to the receiving dock and per our instructions, they asked to inspect it unwrapped before signing, the driver and his companion acted like they didn’t speak English, and acted like they didn’t understand the request and DID NOT allow for the inspection before requiring a signature and leaving without performing ANY of the services we paid for. We want our 75.00 back for this Service  Level  Gold that we paid for and never got. Plesser’s Customer service was fantastic, delivery service, not so much! If you offer a service for extra money, the third party who delivers should honor it. We paid so we could inspect it only and required nothing else from them so it was actually less work since others at our complex took care of the rest, and yet they did not even do that.",2022-05-24T11:06:08.000Z

Delivery of a Washer and Dryer before I even finish the floors, walls, basically nothing necessitated a POD on site - it can never happen again.To have emails sent to clients when we have already given the delivery dates causes worry to clients unnessarily and is very frustrating.To have my three jobs all order from Plessers - Thimble Farm, Hirsch and Lebow and to have issues with communication requires addressing and repair.To have to settle service issues myself with the manufacturer, my wife and the repair company - and with three additional houses signed - made me so embarrassed and angry.I did NOT have these issues with Appliance World and Stuart or Patrick.....I remain hopeful of resolution, team work and SERVICE.",2022-05-24T00:18:30.000Z

They gave a nearly 2 week delivery window and it went over that two week window.  Then once it was scheduled they gave us a 4 hour time window on a Saturday which we agreed to.  Then on Saturday they came over two hours early to our house at which time we were not home and the delivery team acted annoyed that we weren’t there and rushed us to get home as fast as we could.  When we got there, they unpackaged and brought things inside which we paid extra for but then they left all the boxes and packaging on our front lawn instead of taking it or cleaning up after they were done.

We ordered a high-end Cafe' appliance from Plesser's as a result of not being able to get what we wanted from the bigbox stores or locally. Plesser's had what we wanted and was able to deliver and for a fair price! If you're looking for high-end, quality appliances from a company with a solid reputation for availability (if they don't have it, they can get it) and good pricing, Plesser's is the place to go first! We got our appliance within a week or so after ordering. New and beautiful as expected! My wife couldn't be happier!! We will buy from Plesser's again!!!Minor CriticismOn deliverability, know that Plesser's relies on 3rd-party delivery services for some shipments if out of the area. This comes with its challenges and we had some in ours such as the delivery guys wanted to do curbside delivery when we paid for in-home delivery. We didn't complain because my wife is nobody to mess with and got them to do their job.

In late March, I was notified the model I bought was discontinued.  I was sent so-called comparable options that were in stock to select from.  In hindsight, I should have just cancelled my order altogether at this time.  However, I felt rushed to pick one since I had been expecting to have a refrigerator by sometime in April.  After having the appliance for only a little over two weeks, the freezer stopped working and a very loud and unpleasant noise was being made that went on for hours.  Plesser’s just referred me to the manufacturer (GE).  I was able to schedule an appointment with GE to arrive four days later.  When the technician arrived, he noticed that a door hinge was broken/door misaligned and a wheel broken (which scratched up my new floors when trying to pull out the fridge to check on the original problem from my weeks old appliance).  The technician suggested I contact the retailer that I bought it from and ask for a replacement.  Plesser’s was very unhelpful and unwilling to take a return or exchange.  I am now just working with the manufacturer to remedy the situation, as the refrigerator arrived damaged/defective.  The whole process has just been very frustrating, and I am completely dissatisfied with the product as well as the customer service.",2022-05-02T20:32:40.000Z

You've got a customer for life!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I couldn’t possible by more impressed by Plessers after having  a truly horrible experience with a different retailer.  I was trying to replace a gas wall oven with a new unit from a reputable big box store.  I  ordered two different models and waited nine months for them to tell me both were no longer manufactured.  I did some more internet research and found that Plessers had both of the previous ovens in stock on their web site.  I called Mike Gallagher in the Babylon store to confirm this.  He was great.  Quick, professional, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, accommodating.  They had both units in stock. I placed the order over the phone in just a few minutes.  I received several emails from Mike and Plessers confirming specifics a few minutes later.  Three hours later I received a call from Plessers scheduling the installation for the end of the same week.  It was installed as promised and the installation experience was terrific as well.  In and out in 45 minutes.  I live on Long Island but not close to either Plessers Babylon or Southampton stores.  Because of this, I hadn’t really heard about them prior to my attempting to search the internet for my specific models of interest.  I would have thought a larger big box store would offer superior stock and service.  I was absolutely wrong.  I had a similar experience with a different big box store this year when ordering a refrigerator.  Frustrating is an understatement.My subsequent research showed me Plessers has been around well over 100 years and their customers are happy.  I will shop with Plessers for my appliances going forward.  It’s just so much simpler.  I realize this sounds like an advertisement, a shill or fake review.  It truly is not.  Customer Service is important.",2022-04-29T17:10:47.000Z

The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 was the delivery service....once they arrived (an hour and half before the earliest time given) they acted like they were in a track meet to see how fast they could unload it.  Once unloaded I had to tell them to remove the packaging and inspect the appliances, which they looked at me like deer in headlights....they ripped open the boxes and wrapping, took some pics, and left.  All their remnants were left for me to pick up.  Not very professional!",2022-04-28T18:32:41.998Z
"It Took A While, But Plesser's Came Through",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I purchased an oven/microwave combo in late August 2021.  It was delivered within 2 weeks.  However, we were not ready for its installation.  When we uncrated the packaging in December , we discovered that the glass in the microwave oven door was shattered completely.  I immediately called Plerrer's and Casmir Ashimole started the process to have the glass replaced.  He had a repairman come and inspect the damage within a week.  Due to supply issues, the repair was not done for 3 months.  At that time I re-contacted Casmir on a Friday. By the next Wednesday, the door had been replaced and everything works.Many thanks to Casmir for bringing this repair saga to a quick completion.",2022-04-28T17:08:42.103Z

This is a very professional operation.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Daran Riley was the Sales Associate that worked with me in choosing appliances for my kitchen remodel.  He was exemplary in his patience, courtesy and helpfulness through numerous phone conversations, over an extended time period, as my design plans and contractor selection dragged on.  He surprised my by sending an email, with direct links into Presser’s website, to each of the products that we had more or less settled on for my new kitchen. That has made it very easy to provide the detailed info needed for both my designer and contractor.  Plesser’s Customer Service kept me informed on all things necessary up to their notice that the transport company had picked up my items for shipment to California.  AM Home Transport also emailed on the day that they picked up the shipment and provided me with a tracking link and all of their contact information.  I was easily able to contact them to arrange for the removal of an old refrigerator and paid them only the $35 CA recycle fee for that service. AM emailed me when the shipment arrived in the local terminal for delivery, said it was in queue for delivery, that I’d be contacted within 5 business days with a delivery date/time window and that the contact would be at least one day in advance of the delivery date.  I received a call the next day for a Saturday delivery.  We received a call from AM dispatch about 30-minutes prior to the truck arrival.  Two courteous men came with the truck, unloaded and unpacked so we could inspect at curbside before they moved everything into the house, placed it where we needed it to be, and removed the existing refrigerator.  Everything ran smoothly from start to finish, from Daran to delivery into my kitchen. Communication all along the process was excellent.  It took 30 days from order confirmation to delivery.  Given the logistics, distance and all else that’s going on out there in the world, we could not have asked for more.  This is a very professional operation.",2022-04-22T23:31:00.818Z

They would not hold the Fridge for more than 30 Days. So we saw online that Plesser's had the Refrigerator we wanted.  We told Plesser's that we needed the Fridge held for about 60 Days and they accommodated us with NO problem at all.  The best part was the Refrigerator was less than either Home Depot and Lowe's by more than $ 600.00.  Plus Plesser's gave us a 10 Year Warranty at NO extra charge.

"Great customer service, horrible shipping experience",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Our experience with Plesser’s was great!  Customer service was always friendly and seemed to have the answers we needed. However, I’m leaving 2 stars because of our delivery experience. The trucking company-AM Trucking-is the worst trucking company I’ve ever used! It took them 3 weeks from accepting our shipment to contact us for a delivery date. Unfortunately, we were going to be out of town and had to reschedule. On our rescheduled date, I called to get a time and I was told they didn’t have us scheduled. When asked to speak to a manager I was told they were in a meeting and one would call back that night. Of course, they just told me that to get me off the phone. That seems to be their MO. No one could ever put a manager on the phone to speak with me. The next notice we got for a new shipment date was a week later. I took the day off of work and mid morning I get a call stating they won’t be coming. Again, I ask for a manager and was assured we’d get a call back. Nothing.  Finally several days later, our shipment showed up.

I did not see the unit had been dropped on the corner till the following day when I stated to move it into the kitchen. Later you could see the wooden skid removed by the delivery folks was broken on the corner. My disappointment is I am being told this is my issue as I ‘accepted’ the unit. I certainly feel there are circumstances in this cae that warrant a different response. I have asked for a replacement and waiting on a response. This is in addition to the cosmetic damage in the inside of the unit. KippUpdate - Whirlpool stepped up and is replacing the unit. Still be very careful and fully inspect your unit.

During delivery/install the appliances fell and damaged my kitchen island.  I never received a courtesy call to ask how I was doing during the dramatic event.  Plesser’s wiped their hands clean stating I had to go through the delivery company that they subcontract the work to, even though I paid Plesser’s directly for the install/delivery.  A supervisor finally called me (left me a message at 6pm end of their shift) after I asked costumer service to escalate the issue.  I returned the call the next day and haven’t heard back in over a week.  After receiving money for repairs from the delivery company I was sent a text message blaming me for the outcome.  Not once in this whole ordeal did someone apologize for the inconvenience, hassle, and now extra cost of construction happening to my kitchen.

When you have a newly renovated kitchen missing a dishwasher and micro oven combo, what kind of review do you expect. I would give a zero rating, but 1 star is as low a rating I could give. We ordered 5 appliances in total over $11k. The fridge right door doesn't close properly,  and after 2 visits from the service tech, they say it needs a replacement door. I'm just wondering how long we'll need to wait for that too. This is the 1st time we purchased from plessers and the last.

When delivered it could not be installed due to prior 30 year old range configuration.  Next delivery option was over a week away.

Since i had paid for installation when I contacted Peter, he told me since the range was delivered and not installed on the day of delivery, I would have to pay approximately $70.00.  Not sure if that was for delivery but it would have been nice to know up front in the circumstance that I did not require installation that I would be charged (for delivery?).

In fact, it was $200 for an incomplete installation and we spent another $105 to get a real plumber to fix what AM Delivery left undone. We will always hire local in the future for any installation needs, knowing they will stay to complete the work or come back as needed without demanding another fee beyond contracted amount.

I went to several other appliance stores before buying everything for my new kitchen at Plesser's, and while the others were useful to look at some items, the attention to detail and the care and kindness of the staff at Plesser's is unequaled. I have to say that I was even more impressed after I had a problem with something I bought there because the personal service was incredible. I was helped immediately, and even received a follow up call after repairs had been completed to see how everything went.At this point I don't even have to go to the store anymore, unless I don't know  what I want. I bought a gas grill, sight unseen, because I knew exactly which one I wanted, and I was given an amazing price and even better service.

There was surprising attention to detail about delivery and concern for everything even after payment was made.   There was only one glitch that was not Plesser's fault concerning the delivery.   I didn't pay for the extra service to have the delivery company bring my appliance into my home and set it up.   I elected for the free, Bronze Service,  where it was supposed to be delivered in my driveway,  unpacked to inspect for damages,  and the rest left to me.   I hadn't planned on taking off work because I had an adult daughter at home to accept delivery.   The drivers showed up,  dropped the appliance in my garage,  and left without unpacking to verify no damage.   Fortunately the was no damage but my daughter had a difficult time unpacking the large box.   Beside that one hiccup,  it was a better experience than I anticipated!

Good buying experience.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"No other vendor expected to have the Bosch cooktop I wanted in stock for several months. So I was very happy when I found Plesser's had one in stock! I placed my order over the phone and Plesser's did a good job of providing order confirmations and updates via email. I live in Michigan. I placed the order on Thursday and it shipped from Plesser's on Tuesday. The trucking company was AM Home Delivery & Trucking Inc. The product sat at their distribution center in Ohio for 1.5 weeks, however they did an adequate job of informing me of the status via email. The delivery company also sent several emails plus a phone call on the delivery day so I would know the ETA. The delivery was on time and the 2 delivery people courteous. I would definitely buy from Plesser's in the future.",2022-02-15T19:16:54.000Z

Probably not their fault...,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Plessers is general has been great.   They are easy to deal with and have good prices.   My dishwasher was delivered as quoted.  Unfortunately, the dishwasher motor leaks.   This is not really their fault and they had a company come try to fix it, but they couldn't come for two weeks and the motor, which has to be replaced, is on backorder with no estimated date to come in.   So as of today it has been about 5 weeks since I ordered the dishwasher and I still don't have a working appliance and don't know when it will work.

This is our third order from Plessers…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"This is our third order from Plessers and all have gone extremely well. This time, however, due to supply chain issues, part of our order was delayed (ordered in May 2021 and delivered in January 2022). The delay was expected. The challenge was that when we called Plessers to get an update on potentially delivery date, the response was always the same, ""the manufacturer informs us that we should expect delivery approximately the first week of the following month"". This went on for four months before it was actually true. Once the pattern became clear, we tried to get more information-""is this actual data, or just what you are telling people because you don't know when they will be delivered?"" We never could get a straight answer. This is why we only gave them 4 stars-we felt like we got a bit of run around when all we wanted was to be told honestly if they knew when the appliances were coming, or if they had no idea. Instead there was this deception. Other than that, we have great experiences with Plessers and we intend to use them again.",2022-02-06T18:52:40.000Z

I did have to wait for a substantial amount of time for my stove to get delivered, but that’s because of the supply from the manufacturer isn’t what it should be.

Develops frost after 2 weeks,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The purchase process was easy. It took 2 or 3 weeks for delivery. To the very end it was not clear when they deliver.  Refrigerator itself appeared much smaller than we expected. Also, it has large freezing compartment and therefore smaller refrigeration part. Internal shelves, bins made out of thin material and feels flimsy. Also, only one shelf  may be moved down by 1in. Door shelves stationary, unnecessary wide and have large space between them. There are only 3 of them. In general,  shelving design is inefficient: large spaces, which cannot be used efficiently. They claim 11cu f, but usable space is less. After 2 weeks of operation it develops frost in crisper bin. Contacted LG. They suggested to change settings to 0F and 36F. They claimed that these are only the settings for the refrigerator. Week later with ""proper"" settings - frost again. I have bad feeling, that we are getting ito limbo with LG. It is strange to me that out 4 temperature settings, only 0 and 36F is ""proper"".Keep in mind that Plessers does not provide return option (for me).",2022-02-01T02:39:37.000Z

The range came out of the box with some minor damage from the shipping box, IMO from mishandling during shipment.

Liebherr goodness,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a Liebherr 80"" refrigerator from Jennifer at Plessers. This was after a nationwide search. I was fortunate to find they had one in stock. I ordered it the same day and paid a little more for gold care and inside delivery so I can inspect once it was unpackaged in my house.I live in Colorado so right away I was worried about shipping and possibility of damage. I have heard plenty of horror stories and this was an especially sensitive item with stainless on three sides. AM was the trucking company. Plessers and AM handled everything smoothly, through my repeated questions about concerns, all the way through to the delivery. The 80"" tall all stainless fridge arrived in a very thick, well protected cardboard box, with thick styrofoam sounding all sides top and bottom, and the stainless had a protective film on it. I am very happy with the unit. I am happy with Plessers and the shipping company.

When have you ever seen a flight of stairs as 7 steps?  They were trying to get more money from me a delivery.  It was an absolute scam!

Samsung Stove and Disposal,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"To be honest with you not over thrilled. My first purchase was a stove which came damaged, although you did send another out right away. The price of the stove also was much less than any other supplier. Do love the stove. So I gave you the benefit of the doubt and ordered a dishwasher. That came damaged and you claimed that was the last one you had. So I am scheduled to have replacement parts installed 12/29/21. We will see how that goes. If I was you if the damage is not happing at your warehouse maybe stop shipping with A&M . Guess my biggest disappointment is your web sit claims to have appliances in stock when that is not true.Respectfully yours,Jack",2021-12-29T00:31:36.000Z

Ordering and delivery was a snap,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Ordering and delivery was a snap. Delivered on time and in perfect condition. Looks great. Love the layout and the 2 freezer drawers. I thought we would be giving up freezer space but it works out great not having to open the whole freezer to get ice. It also keeps items in freezer more organized. We also like the water dispenser not on the door. We have had problems with our last 2 previous refrigerators with the door ice and water dispensers breaking or water lines freezing up. Only issue was with the dimensions of the counter depth units. Stated required opening is only good if cabinets are on both sides of the refrigerator. Ours is next to a doorway which comes out 3 inches more than a standard cabinet. We originally had a standard depth unit so you need to add 3 inches to your required opening to fully open the doors on the counter depth model. So now I have a counter depth model that I can not have flush with the counter. It would have been better to go with the standard depth and got a bigger fridge for less money and fit better.,2021-12-27T21:55:27.000Z

KitchenAid refrigerator KRFF507HPS,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Dear Plesser's and Ms. Jennifer O'Brien,I dearly love my new KitchenAid fridge KRFF507HPS. It meets and exceeds my expectations.I am willing to give 4.5* to 4.9* to Plesser's but I cannot give it a 5* because: - Fridge deliverers just opened box, pushed the fridge in my desired position in garage, but did not help me to secure the 2 rubber pads/ feet near the 2 front doors of the fridge to ""stick"" the fridge down to my tile floor. Therefore, hours later when I opened the fridge's doors the fridge funnily moved out towards me as a ""stainless steel giant monster"" who was challenging me. Then I had to read the fridge manual very carefully and lower down those 2 rubber pads/ feet so my new and beloved fridge can be ""sticked down tight"" to the tile floor. I also had to srcew in the 3  handles for 3 doors.   These are minor issues. But, to a ""gold delivery"" option, this simple little thing should be done to help the “know-nothing” fridge owner.- When I asked the 2 fridge deliverers about helping me to connect of the stainless-steel water line which I had bought from Plesser's they declined to help. Or they were not familiar to do this water line connection. To other company like Home Depot, etc. the delivery contractors are willing to help the fridge owner connect the water line; haul away old broken bridge at $25, etc.- Deliverers declined to haul away my 5 1/2 years old, 32 cb ft bad model, broken KitchenAid fridge ""except Plesser prepaid them"".  - Home Depot has now reduced the price of this same fridge to be 100% competitive with Plesser's.- Other than that, I had pleasant experience in conducting business with Plesser's, especially to Ms. Jennifer O'Brien, sale clerk/ manager, during my process of inquiry and purchase of my fridge. Much thanks to Jennifer and Plesser's. Will buy more at Plesser's. Good luck with Plesser’s very well-established company and your businesses. Thanks again.  God bless America. God bless Plesser’s, its management and its stock holders.Sincerely,",2021-12-24T03:20:50.000Z

You will wait...and wait...and wait,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Update/edit:I stand by my original review below, in that Plesser's should be honest with the delivery time window they provide, and should find a better shipping company.However, everything else about their service has been great, including quickly replacing a part with a defect. I'd say overall that rounds out to 3 stars.===========Do NOT order anything unless you can get a shipping company OTHER than AM Home Delivery. Horrible experience so far; Plesser's should partner with a different, competent company immediately, because no matter how well Plesser's themselves may do, their shipping option is a huge disservice to their customers, going by my experience.I had no problems placing the order and the refrigerator was shipped out quickly and made it to the last-mile stage well on schedule. Then the refrigerator sat in a warehouse for 2 weeks until the last day of the original delivery window, when it was finally scheduled for delivery. Just 1 day late, fine. Get a call the day of delivery that truck broke down, rescheduled for next day, that's okay.But, next delivery day, I still get nothing. The scheduled time window passes, I wait another hour and call....The fridge was on the truck, but the route manager told the drivers to skip our stop/delivery. (????)No one knows why, but I'm promised a call back. Days later, no call back, so I call back myself. Still no explanation, only that there was a ""miscommunication"" with the drivers.And now I have to wait ANOTHER two weeks for re-delivery.Did I mention this fridge was needed for wedding preparations (now passed!) and ordered well in advance for that?This company will charge YOU if you aren't home for the scheduled delivery.But they have NO respect for your time, or the time you took off work to accept their delivery, and won't attempt to explain themselves.Their quality of service matches whatever cheap shipping fees they offer that keeps Plesser's from switching to a reputable shipping company.A quick search showed me that my experience with AM Home delivery has actually been the typical fare.I think Plesser's is probably well aware by now of what they're offering their customers with this freight company, and it's a spit in the face.The estimated delivery date Plesser's originally gave me was the EARLIEST that the AM Home Delivery tracking info later showed. Very dishonest for Plesser's to cherry-pick the earliest possible arrival.So, shop Plesser's if you wanna save a couple bucks... and can afford to wait weeks upon weeks and take time off work a few times when the drivers skip you willy-nilly.",2021-12-14T18:42:12.000Z

Really dissatisfied,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought an entire set of GE appliances at Plessers, and after 3 weeks the dishwasher began leaking. Spent a lot of money, and truly feel like the customer service department is getting me absolutely nowhere.  Tried to set up a service call, first time they could come was 6 days later.  Then someone made a clerical error when  entering the information, and the service company didn’t come. Set up a new call for 5 days later, so in total it took 11 days. Service company finally came yesterday, and assured us the problem was fixed. We ran it for the first time the next day, and the dishwasher is still leaking. Now it’s Saturday and I have a flood on my floor and a still broken dishwasher, which has been used less than 10 times.",2021-12-12T01:34:28.000Z

I’m sorry to have to give this review,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’m sorry to have to give this review. Unfortunately no one seems to want to stand up and help us with this issue including Samsung and Plessers. See below:Just spent an hour with a samsung customer service agent concerning the shelving cracking on a 1.5 year old refrigerator. Her response was it was out of warranty so we should just order new ones. I responded that I would like to speak to a manager and ask why a so called high quality refrigerator that cost over $2000 is falling apart. After another 15 minutes of typing noise her answer was NO.Not sure why they even have a customer service number because there is no concern for the customer. Good luck trying to speak to a manager. In my case all I got was typing noise. As for me, samsung did not care about the customer nor did they care if I would stay a customer. In my case they also did not care about the poor quality of this refrigerator.I will never buy any samsung products!As for Plessers, we got a similar response “it’s not our problem, it’s 6 months out of warranty, you should have purchased an extended warranty, contact Samsung, have a good day”We contacted Samsung - they have no interest in standing behind their product. This is why we reached out to you, we purchased an entire kitchen full of Samsung products. We relied on your sales department to sell us quality, not junk. You where quick to take the sale and even offered to beat my local appliance store (my mistake for not purchasing local).Ether way we need to replace these plastic junk shelved.I guess sometimes it better to pay more and get a company to stand beside the consumer and do the right thing.“Have a nice day”",2021-12-11T01:29:24.000Z

That is service that goes above and beyond!!! Thank you Plesser!

When the refrigerator did show up it was damaged and had to be returned. The next refrigerator that was delivered was also damaged and they said they couldn't get me another one and offered me like $250 to keep it. It had major damage and I didn't want it and I had to have Costco come out again.  I did receive a full refund but what a hassle the whole experience was and it took almost 3 months. I found Plesser's and had a courteous helpful sales person take my order and get everything going quickly.

I called the next day, apparently same rep answered, and was informed of a $49.00 delivery fee (2 miles away mind you), $40.00 haul away for old appliance, and $149.00 hook up charge on top of the almost $200.00 difference on same range at Home Depot who delivered and installed for free and $25.00 haul away.

"Great Service, Great Prices, Great Installation, What more could you ask for?",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"It was time to replace our GE washer and dryer. Many of my friends and neighbors suggested I go to Plessers in Babylon because of their great pricing and selection. I did some research and decided on a Maytag washer and gas dryer plus I wanted them asap. I gave the model numbers over the phone to the sales manager Joe. He checked and said they were available in the warehouse. The next day I went to the store in Babylon and Joe introduced me to Eric Cullen, one of the salesmen who would write up my order. The first thing that Eric told me was that he and Joe checked the model numbers I gave them and asked if I was aware that the top consoles with the control knobs were two different colors (stainless steel and black plastic). I must have missed that and of course wanted them to match. Eric showed me another Maytag dryer model that matched my chosen washer exactly plus it actually was less expensive than the original dryer I had chosen. How many salesmen would do that? The order was written on a Sunday and as per my request, the washer and dryer were delivered and hooked up the following Saturday (previous appliances taken away for a small fee). After doing a few washes already, we couldn't be more pleased with our new Maytags. Great service, very competitive pricing, quick delivery, pleasant and informative salespeople like Eric.

Appliances fine but delivery/pick up not worth the hassle,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I have been very satisfied with the purchases that I’ve made (an oven and refrigerator), HOWEVER, the delivery company that Plesser’s uses is an absolute NIGHTMARE to work with. The drivers/installers are good but the coordination for deliver and pickup of old appliances is horrendous. I waited a MONTH to have the old refrigerator picked up. I was promised a removal the day I had the new one delivered and they “had no room” so every week for the next month; I had to sit on hold for an hour to “reschedule”, was told to basically set aside an entire day to be available for the newly scheduled pick up and then was told EACH WEEK.... at the end of that day I had set aside...AGAIN...that there was no room. I was never allowed to speak to a manager at the Trucking company. I was given a number that Always went to voicemail. Finally, someone at Plesser’s was able to force them to pick the appliance up, but that experience alone makes me want more to look elsewhere For my appliances despite how good the Plesser staff and appliances seem to be!!!

I was told I could track the delivery online. Weeks go by and the item is still waiting for pickup. I called the store and was told they lost the refrigerator and they will place another order which was already three weeks late. Then I had to wait 4 more weeks for delivery. On delivery day the third party vendor hired to deliver the refrigerator took my door off and didn't put the door back properly, stripped the screws and put in some inferior screws and scratched my door now doesn't close properly without lifting it up. I put in a claim to get the door fixed with no response. I paid for gold service but I think I got a lump of coal instead. The refrigerator was supposed to be installed but couldn' t be installed because the water line wasn't included with the order. The water line would have cost me 40 dollars for a 15 dollar part from Home Depot so they left the refrigerator in the house didn't take the box the the refrigerator came in and left. I went to my local Home Depot picked it up the water line kit for 15 dollars and in stalled it and pushed the refrigerator in place. Last but not least, I received a call 2 days after the delivery to install the lost refrigerator that I previously ordered. This is absolutely ridiculous and now I have to pay to get me door fixed.

My appliance purchase from Plesser’s…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,My appliance purchase from Plesser’s was one of the best experiences i have ever had.  My order was placed online and then someone reached out to me over the phone to go over the purchase of each item one by one.  I had missed purchasing a door handle for a dish washer because the brand i ordered sold handles separately and this was resolved in this phone conversation.  When I received my appliances i had a dent in the dish washer and a fridge.  But the packaging had no damage to it at all which i felt was odd.  So immediately i felt oh boy this is going to be a issue based on similar situations with other companies.  Melanie DeFalco with customer support was who handled my issue when i emailed in my problem.  Immediately the issue was being handled after a picture and serial number confirmation.  Everything was fixed perfectly and Melanie went out of her way to make sure it was handled in a very timely manner.  I must say the timing of all this far exceeded my expectations.

This is deplorable policy and one that I have never herd of in any company. Your vustomere was no existent for your South Hampton store after multiple calls. I frankly don’t know how you stay in business and I can not be more disappointed in my purchase with Plesser not honoring there own advertisement to always satisfy the customer.

On delivery both doors and hinges had to be removed in order to bring the fridge into the house. On reassembly everything was put back together but the doors were way out of adjustment. Remember ALL HINGES were removed without any markings on the fridge in order to reassemble the doors correctly. I pointed out to the installer that the doors were way out of adjustment and his reply was I didn't have WHITE GLOVE delivery. I didn't take white glove delivery because under normal circumstances the only thing that had to be done was to plug it in and push it back into the hole. There was no water hook up. So for the next day and half I had to play around with the adjustments until they were right. Good thing I was a retired contractor who concentrated on high end kitchen and baths,2021-08-31T16:26:41.000Z

Highly recommend,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their customer service and problem resolution. My gas range arrived with damage. When I called Plesser's, they requested pictures of the damage. Then they scheduled a manufacturer's rep to come out and see if the side panel could be replaced. Unfortunately, the rep determined that the range had been dropped, and felt that it could have unseen damage and be unsafe. When I called Plesser's back, they contacted the rep to verify, and requested a picture of the serial number. They scheduled a replacement range to be delivered. The second one arrived with no damage. To my mind, the best measure of a vendor is how they handle problems and the unexpected. Plesser's is 5 stars. Highly recommend.",2021-08-27T19:54:29.000Z

Plesser's saved me,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's saved me. I live in the Austin, TX area and wanted high-end (800-series) Bosch appliances for my kitchen remodel. I at first started with a local appliance supplier but in these COVID times they kept doing week for week slips on their appliance deliveries, imperiling my schedule.I found Plesser's by accident. I'd never heard of them before and the website was clumsy enough that it seemed scam-adjacent. However, after doing some research, they seemed like a legitimate company so I went for it -- and wasn't disappointed. Moreover, their ""in stock and ready to ship"" icon is in my limited experience completely accurate. I used that to guide SKU selections for my appliances and found all appliances ordered arriving within 3 weeks of my order time, including a Bosch 800-series dishwasher which my local supplier claimed ""no one can get.""The shipping estimates and ease of ordering/delivery are so easy that I think I've successfully persuaded my general contractor to go with Plesser's over the local distributors.",2021-08-26T18:57:02.000Z

Best of all, Plessers had the dryer in stock and priced hundreds of dollars lower than the competition!  Peter M was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and he did this all over the phone!When the dryer was delivered, the team was extremely careful and diligent in the placement and installation of the dryer.  They replaced the gas connection and added a split to the water hose to enable the steam feature.

Plesser's blamed the trucking company, and the trucking company blamed Plesser's.  Someone was supposedly going to get back to me.  No one did.  I called again and told the same thing with the same result.  Then I called again... I was assured that it was on its way and just wasn't scanned... I was told to wait until it arrived locally, and the fridge would show up, too.  Sadly, this didn't happen.  I called again and was told that someone was going to look for it and get back to me.  No one did.  I called again and was told that someone was ""working on it"" and they would get back to me.  Of course no one did, so I canceled my full order.  We asked for a supervisor a few times and were told that there was no one else we could talk to.  Plus hold times were ridiculous.  AM Home Delivery (the trucking company) was even worse.  Once I was on hold for nearly 3 hours trying to speak to someone there, and their tracking system is garbage.The price was good, and I REALLY wanted this to work out.  However, clearly it didn't.  I ended up just buying at a local big box store and had the items in my home the next afternoon.  I ended up paying more, but how much was my time and headache worth?

She told me just tell them when they get there. They will charge $35. I said fine.  When the company delivered the refrigerator the would NOT take the old refrigerator because it wasn't on their workforce.  They left the dead refrigerator and the mountain of box and packing material in my shared driveway and delivered the refrigerator but did not do anything but put it in place and plug it in.  Handles were not installed, shelving inside weren't set into service positions.  I live in a condo complex and could not leave all that stuff in the driveway so was forced to find the quickest possible way to remove it.  I called 1800 GOT JUNK because of the way the delivered left things.  They were here within about 2 hours for $150.  What do I want?  I want to be reimbursed.the money i had to spend over $35. Your salesperson called me about this calling it a Courtesy Call.  There was nothing courteous about it.  I have other appliances I can buy but I want to know that your salesperson is retrained and I want back the balance over $35.  I was absolutely told this by the salesperson.  I am left to wonder if she was in a hurry and just screwed this up.  Nobody is perfect.

Incredibly quiet and solid dishwasher,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Bosch dishwashers are extremely hard to find in CA, so I ordered from Plesser's and am a very satisfied customer. Delivery came at the beginning of the time frame quoted. The guys wanted to leave the box in the garage, but I asked them to bring it into the house and unbox it so I could inspect it (since that is part of gold service) and they did. One small complaint, I wish gold service included removal of the packing material. I did the installation myself and the dishwasher is stunning. So quiet, the only time you can tell it's running is when it drains. I do wish it had Home Connect or Time Light (displays time remaining on floor instead of red light) but it's a fantastic dishwasher.

We contracted with Plessers to have the refrigerator and freezer installed.  A large portion of the job consisted of putting together a stainless steel trim kit which surrounds both units.  Unfortunately the job was never completed.  Techs came to install the trim kit but we did not have the units emptied ahead of time; no one told us that was necessary.  They told us to reschedule; but their attitudes implied they were not too familiar with this; better luck with the next crew.  Despite several attempts to reschedule a new appointment none came to fruition.  We deduced that the installers didn't want to return to our home because we challenged their skills and they were not well versed with this job.  In the end, we were lucky enough to have our contractor install components including the wheel assemblies and strapping but he still was unable to install the stainless moulding.   Plessers insisted we had the right kit but through further investigation we learned Plessers never provided the kit specs to the cabinet maker and therefore the space made for the fridge and freezer was too narrow.  Plessers ignored our calls for further assistance and would not reschedule a new appointment.  They knew they were unable to finish this job and sadly left us hanging to this day.  Extremely disappointed!",2021-08-15T16:28:07.000Z

Disappointing service and quality,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We wanted to support a local business and expected a higher level of customer service than big box stores. They were able to offer delivery for a new refrigerator quickly. We were offered extended warranties, which we purchased. We were offered installation, which was explained as connecting the water line. We declined since we could do that ourselves. The fridge was delivered and the doors were installed by the delivery crew. We noticed right away that the left door felt very heavy compared to the right door. I was about to have a baby so we didn’t get to address this until 2 weeks later. I called customer service and they told me that since I didn’t pay for installation, they would not service the door. They suggested I have my husband read the manual and fix it himself. I let them know this was not explained to us and that we paid for all the service contracts and the fridge was brand new and they still refused to correct this. We are so disappointed with the lack of service and feel cheated for choosing to support a local business. We now have a brand new fridge that is off balance and no one to stand behind the integrity of the product.",2021-08-09T23:10:46.000Z

I reached out to Melanie DeFalco again and she immediately arranged for Plesser's installers to return a to swap the machine positions and without a charge.

They still are. Yippee.  When I needed a new washer dryer to replace my 16 year old set, I called Plesser for help.  This time it was during Covid.  My experience still was a positive one but since manufacturing closed down, it took almost 6 weeks before I finally got my laundry up and running.  Again Plesser guided through the entire experience, made suggestions and followed through.  Thanks to their competent team.",2021-07-26T14:43:47.000Z
Horrible shipping experience,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The shipping company you used to deliver was the worst.  3 days of no shows after confirmation of delivery,  then delivery on a day I told them not to.

Even One Star is Too Much!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"""With Plesser's you can expect comparable prices, knowledgeable staff, professional delivery, and excellent after sales service.""...only one of these statements is true & that is the professional delivery.Ordering my washer & dryer through Plesser's Appliance of Southampton was one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. For 39 years, I have worked in the luxury retail industry & have conducted customer service seminars internationally. This Plesser nightmare began back in March.when I decided to convert my coat closet into a washer/dryer space. I went online for price comparisons & was pleasantly surprised to discover that Plesser's had comparable, if not better pricing than the big box stores. My only contact for these past 4 months was with the store manager. Most of my communication with him was by email. His recommendation was an Asko Washer & Dryer. On March 22, I requested pricing including delivery/installation & if they were in stock. He answered my questions & said $349 for delivery/installation. So, I proceeded with my order & he confirmed I should have the washer/dryer by mid-April.On April 19, I asked for an update since I hadn't heard from him in almost a month. He responded that my order had been delayed until May 25. I accepted this new delivery date but wondered why I hadn't been informed.On May 17, I asked for a delivery update.On May 20, I asked for another update (second request) only to be told my order had been pushed back to July 8! I only discovered these new dates because I asked not because the information had been offered to me, the customer. I then asked what is the store's solution for this customer service issue? The manager recommended a GE washer/dryer. When I asked if the dryer could be vented on the side, he sent me an email attachment of the pamphlet to read. I then called the GE representative myself & she assured me that the dryer could be side vented.On June 14, I asked for an update on the GE delivery only to receive an automated email response that he would be out of the office until June 2!Then, on June 15, from Plesser's Customer Support Center, I received an invoice confirmation of $2684.10 all inclusive with a ""schedule to ship"" date of June 23.Then, on June 21, I received another invoice confirmation from customer support of $2906.77 with no explanation of the difference.On June 24, I sent an email to the store manager, marketing department, & customer service asking why there was a difference of $222.67 between the 2 invoices.On June 28 the store manager responded: ""we had to add items to complete the installation."" with no further explanation.When I went through the invoice line by line, the installation/delivery totaled $400, $50 over his original quote back in March. Also, there was a $55 charge for an ""exhaust cover plate"". I sent an email request asking for an explanation of this charge since I already had a cover plate installed. As of this date, I am still waiting for his reply.On July 9, from customer service, I received an announcement of their appliance sale and guess what? My washer & dryer were included in the sale $531.80 less than I paid! So I sent an email to marketing, customer service, & the store manager asking for a price adjustment since only 2 weeks had elapsed since my installation.No response.Then on July 14, I sent a second request to the same 3 (marketing, customer service, & the store manager) with the manager's response: ""once the appliances are installed, we do not offer price adjustments"".Moral of this story - do not buy your appliances at Plesser's!",2021-07-21T21:10:54.000Z

The End of a Good Business Relationship,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been a Plesser’s customer for years, bought many appliances, and referred them to countless people…but no more. Plesser’s customer service is top notch but their contract trucking company, AM Home Delivery and Trucking Company, is the worst. Plesser’s said to call AM Trucking to add the haul away service to the order. I’ve called three times, and I’ve been #50, 33, and 30 in line. They have never returned a call or an email.  In addition, they are weeks behind on the estimated delivery. I intentionally ordered a dryer that Plesser’s had in stock. The trucking company picked it up from Plesser’s a few days later and now the trucking company has had it for more than a month. Those laundromat bills add up quickly. It’s a shame Plesser’s doesn’t have a better trucking company. I really enjoyed doing business with them. But no more.",2021-07-19T18:40:26.000Z

Plessers Is Great / Delivery Is Terrible,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Plessers' sales staff, and the equipment and prices, were fantastic. Jennifer was responsive and provided great recommendations.   Unfortunately, Plessers sells the delivery services and charges the added costs for the Gold Premium Delivery.  The transport company, AM Trucking, dropped the ball several times.  They do not answer calls, leave Plessers' customers on hold for extended periods, and then do not timely schedule delivery.  In our case, through no fault of ours, AM Trucking had our fully paid appliances in its custody in New York on or around June 15, and it did not deliver to our Ohio home until July 12, 2021.   In the meantime, we were constantly following up by phone at AM Trucking's numbers listed on their website and emails.  We waited on hold for hours.  We were promised return calls by the automated attendant and also by operators that we finally reached, but we received no return calls.  When AM Trucking finally made the delivery to our Ohio home, the two men admitted that was was only their second day with the company, and they did not know how to perform the contracted services.  They also misplaced a cord that we purchased and had no record of the item.  Plessers is great.  Its selected transport company fulfilling the ""free"" delivery is unreliable.",2021-07-13T21:27:19.000Z

Bad Communication & Poor Order Execution,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I have used Plessers once in the past without issue, but my most recent experience gives me pause about working with them in the future. I had placed my appliance order well before needing the delivery (four months) in anticipation of long lead times given the industry's supply chain issues. Throughout the four months of fulfillment time I spoke with various members of Plesser's staff on a number of occasions about my appliances order status, and at no point was I given a warning that the company may not be able to fulfill my appliance order on time. It was not until I reached out because my order had not been shipped by the delivery deadline that I discovered that Plessers did not have multiple items in my appliance order, and that the items would be on backorder for at least another two months.I understand that there are supply chain issues affecting the industry, but the total lack of warning from Plessers left me scrambling and ultimately resulted in me having to spend $1000+, as well as losing my hefty appliance rebate, which easily could have been avoided had the company given me some warning of the fulfillment issues. Totally disappointing experience, and until supply chains get a little less pinched, I would recommend avoiding Plessers if you have a project that requires hitting hard deadlines.",2021-07-12T21:18:09.000Z
Taking a chance on an out-of-state company paid off with good service,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Our refrigerator was pronounced unfixable recently and, with the inventory challenges of the pandemic, we had trouble finding a unit that would fit our kitchen locally. Lowes, Home Depot, etc. all said they could get it to us by October (about 4 months at the time). I found the exact unit on the Plessers site. Being several states away, I was a little hesitant but John, the sales guy worked through everything with me to make sure the unit was right for the space and that we could really get a fridge delivered from Long Island to Virginia. He was great to deal with. The unit arrived a couple weeks later, ahead of schedule, and was installed well by the contracted group. I was also surprised and impressed that we received regular progress updates. All around, a great purchase. Enough so that i took time out to write this review.",2021-07-12T21:03:41.000Z

Then they rescheduled for Friday then they rescheduled again for Saturday delivery then they unloaded the truck with two items even though I had three items and I had to let them know then I was supposed to have it unpacked and looked at but they just dropped it off took pictures of the barcode and left.

3 Strikes and I am out....,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The folks at Plesser are top notch.  My experience, however was not good.  I ordered an oven, dishwasher and a couple of other pieces in December 2020.  Received the dishwasher etc. in March.  The oven was delayed due to COVID.  Make a long story short, Plesser shipped me 3 ovens, all arriving with visible damage to the metal cabinet.   The last oven was received on July 1st.  I refused the 3 ovens since I was concern at the unknown internal damage and upon calling BOSCH, they confirm that the warranty would be void had I accepted the oven.  It is negligence on Plesser's part to ship ovens, specially after two with the same issue, without taking precaution that the merchandise is not damaged upon leaving the warehouse and/or adding extra packaging to ensure no damage in transit.   At the end of the day, Plesser will not fulfill my order (i.e. send the fourth oven).   I wasted 4 months, prices have increased 20% and none of the local retailer have the oven in stock.  I am screwed.  I have a kitchen suite that I need to match, no oven, a wait god knows how long and a 20% higher cost.  All I wanted is what a paid for; an undamaged oven.

I had to find a shipping company on my own and they were horrible. They didn't show up 6x in a row and finally showed and shipped it back. Plesser's said the sub zero freezer had the hinges taken off, which it clearly had not because we had not even opened it and refused to give me a refund. Complete scam.",2021-06-30T12:52:58.000Z

We wanted the SE (Special Edition) because it came with the stainless steel grills and it also came with the light that attaches to the handle.  This grill was very difficult to find online and was unavailable locally.  We also wanted two of them, which made it even harder to find.  Plesser's had the grills in stock.  I was concerned about the ""curbside"" delivery, since these grills are heavy.  I still remember ordering some speakers once and the delivery people literally left them at the curb at the bottom of my driveway.  I asked Plesser's if they could at least have them placed in the garage for the ""curbside"" price.  No problem, the changed the delivery info so that they would place them in my garage.

We changed our order to a regular slide in GE electric range.  It isn't the range we wanted, but we realize due to the pandemic we would have to settle for another model.  The representatives at Plesser's were always very polite and helpful.  We also received an extra extended warranty on the oven and microwave from Plesser's for no extra charge.  The shipment of our oven was just as they told us when we ordered it.  We received a phone call from their company 2 days prior to delivery, and on the day of delivery.

I made several phone calls to zero success. I sent texts and the replies were solicitation to buy more stuff, very frustrating. About two days after I received a call to come back and install. Installation was flawless. Very happy at the end but I don't wish my worst enemy the experience.",2021-05-18T15:02:49.000Z
I give Plessers a BIG 5 star but trucking company is unreliable,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I give Plessers a BIG 5 star rating, but the overall purchase lost a star because of the delivery experience. Plessers would be well-served to use someone besides AM Trucking. They were a nightmare. Plessers however, was great: Good products, good price, helpful sales, helpful follow-up. I will buy from them again, but I will insist on someone else to deliver. AM Trucking did not update the delivery schedule during the week that my appliance was in transit. Once they picked it up in NJ, they did not update the status until I got a call less than 24 hours ahead telling me they were coming at a time when I had an out of town trip planned for weeks. Poor communication. They rescheduled for the next week-five days later! They set the time window of 6-10 PM. I made sure I could be there, moving some things to the afternoon. I received a text at 3 that day that they would be there within the hour, over 2 hours early from the agreed-upon time. I called them and was mis-led by the driver, then told I would get a call back as soon as he talked to his dispatcher. No call. No one came between 6 and 10, and no one answered the phone. They finally called the next day to tell me that they were coming on Saturday. I changed weekend travel plans to accommodate them. It finally arrived, with some damage. Plessers took care of it, but AM Trucking should be fired. Love Plessers, love my fridge!",2021-05-17T20:29:58.000Z

I removed the suds, with an Allen wrench and my son helped me bring it into our house. I had the Gold delivery option and it was supposed to be delivered to the room of my choice.

DONT BOTHER,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"DONT BOTHER, IM SURE THIS WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION. They were nice in the beginning after they got our deposit On Black Friday,  it went down hill from there. During pandemic times Emily DiGiovanna and Joe Jackson assured and guaranteed  us in person on three separate occasions all our appliances are in and scheduled for delivery. Either they lied to us or sold our appliances to someone else. They both did not have any answers. On the week of our delivery date  in late April we were notified we would not be getting our range, and hoood, and Emily said they are out of stock till June. I went to PC Richards not only did they have one they had ELEVEN of them in stock.  They pride themselves in CUSTOMER SERVICE and great Customer service was far from it.,  The best way to get an answer  is to go in person, they dont return calls, dont pick up the PHONE, (charge your phone) or reply emails. I have proof.  SAVE YOUR SELF THE AGGRAVATION don't even bother buying from them. never again. ONLY competent, caring representatives are John DeSenso and Daniel Lastraglio who took the time and had answers. I emailed the owners the Mr. M. Howard and A. Howard (owners) and you would think at least their secretary will get back to us.  I regret ever walking into this place!

Mixed review,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,We ordered our appliances in January and received a call in late February to schedule delivery of ALL of our appliances.  We weren’t ready with construction. Two more phone calls and they said it would all go to the warehouse which was fine with us. We call to take delivery in April and they said not all the pieces were available. Come to find stove was damaged(or they sold it to someone else) . Things happen but no phone call was ever made to explain that they were ordering a new stove. We were told mid May-not acceptable. Took a few phone calls and we were able to get the floor model. Very frustrating experience! Thankfully Stephanie called to check in with us through this and was super delightful to work with!,2021-05-15T10:50:50.000Z

The Viking repair person can to look at the 2nd one, and his notes said, ""Unrepairable"".  Plessers tried to hide the fact that they were not going to replace it.  They just wanted to pick it up and refund my money.  Like, I don't need a refrigerator and it was my fault.  I had to purchase from another company, and it was perfect.  I'm still waiting on my induction range.  They have now told me mid July.  I strongly recommend avoiding this company.

I understand there were supply issues associated with the first model but I always seemed to be chasing for information rather than that information being pushed to me and, when bearing in mind the considerable delay (regardless of reason), there was never mention of any form of compensation which was rather disappointing. I have to say that once we changed model the process went very smoothly and for that I would like to thank your representatives.

Buyer Beware,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been waiting to write this review with the hopes that my experience would turn around, but unfortunately it has not. I placed my order on January 11, 2021 and was told 3 out of the 4 items were backordered and would be available to ship two weeks later which wasn’t a problem, so I proceeded with the order. FIVE ship windows and FOUR months later, I just received the last two items only to find out Plesser’s changed the dishwasher I ordered to another model without informing me or getting my approval. I was already frustrated with their lack of credibility when it came to ship dates (their ship windows mean nothing! and they truly have no idea when you will receive your items), so for the item to be swapped without even telling me put this on a whole other level. I emailed the customer service group twice on Thursday (4/29/21) and now again today (5/3/21) to find out why this happened, and no one is responding to me. About a month after I first placed my order, I had a question, so I reached out to the sales rep Jennifer O’Brien. She was very short with me and unwilling to answer any questions. Apparently she had gotten her sale and moved on. This is when I first realized there were serious issues with this company, and it only magnified from there. My advice to anyone considering using Plesser’s, DON’T DO IT. They have poor customer service, they don’t deliver what you ordered, and their ship windows are substantially unreliable.",2021-05-03T21:54:09.000Z

Then to be really laced it would be another 2 months minimum on backorder. I’ll buy local and save the headache. Also, their delivery company they use, Am trucking doesn’t deliver and inspect the items as we are told to do. They take off and leave you hanging. I asked them to take the stove as soon as I saw it was damaged and they wouldn’t. Told me to call the company and they left.

Refrigerator final delivery issues.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"If I was just reviewing the purchase of my refrigerator and not including the delivery, it would be a five star rating. The final delivery to my room of choice was an issue. Even though I told several people that the doors would need to be removed to get refrigerator into my kitchen, the delivery guys had no idea that needed to happen. They also claimed to have no tools to do the removal. After much discussion and them using my tools, the refrigerator was finally put in my kitchen. If I hadn’t insisted on it being placed in my kitchen, it would likely still be sitting in my garage. No one ever got back to me on the cost of removing the doors or cost of recycling of my old fridge. This was the second time I made a purchase through Plessers and I really like the prices they offer and I would recommend them if the shipping issues can be corrected.",2021-04-25T03:19:29.000Z

Again, March 31,  nothing have happened,  got the following feedback: ""Thank you for contacting us. I reached out to AM Home Delivery as soon as we got your inquiry. They advised that your order is due to arrive at the final delivery hub the beginning to middle of next week and that upon arrival, the route manager will reach out to with a delivery date"".  This is April 8th,  2 month after I've placed an order for an item listed ""in stock,  ready to ship"" - I still have not received an item and I have no idea when I will.   I do not understand why plessers.com website deliberately mislead the customers that items are in stock.  I do not understand why plesser's customer service mislead the customers about delivery of the items.  I don't believe this is a good business practice and I do not understand why plesser's are doing this.  All I was looking for is an honest answer,  and if I knew that I had to wait for 2 month (+ probably more) - I would never placed an order.   When I called to request a refund sometimes mid March - I was told that fees will apply as item is most likely shipped.   To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement.    I hope this information will help plesser's to change their business practices.",2021-04-08T23:00:59.000Z

Buyer Beware,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Plessers misrepresented delivery at about 6 weeks and took over 3 months.

The key word is ready to ship then you call 2 weeks or so later and told well we found out it had damage so we are reordering then excuse after excuse while they have already charged credit card. Then told again and again being shipped but took weeks to come from New York to Ga where again a New York delivery company (which Plessers refuses to provide contact info) so the CUSTOMER  is told THEY will wait until delivery company has time again weeks of wait while Pessers has thousands of your money . The delivery company make claims delivery text message are sent to cover up deceit but cannot submit said text messages when ask to resend or snap shot.  By the way you can cancel if you don’t like the way you are treated for $375.00 In opinion, absolutely worse company ever dealt with. Buyer beware.

Upon the second visit to deliver the refrigerator, my wife received the shipment. Unfortunately she missed a nice dent in the side and a small wear mark on the protruding door handle. ( probably because she was so excited for the refrigerator after having to wait for it a second time). The shipping box had holes in the side where the dent was and the plastic was worn off the handle and clearly allowed the handle to rub on the carboard box for some time. I accept that damages had to be noted on delivery, so unfortunately we're stuck with a cosmetic flawed unit, or sucking up the cost of a new door handle at minimum.",2021-03-31T23:28:31.000Z

Great Experience Buying Hard-To-Find Dishwasher,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"While recently shopping for a dishwasher, I discovered another casualty of Covid - appliance manufacturing. We did our research and were all ready to buy a Bosch dishwasher and quickly discovered that there were none to be found within 200 miles of where we live, and Bosch couldn't even give me an estimate of when they would have inventory to sell again. A Google search came back with Plesser's having the exact model we were looking for in stock. I assumed this was an error, but I called anyway to verify, and sure enough was assured that they had a brand new one in stock. Having never bought a major appliance online from so far away (we live outside New Orleans), I was still thinking this is too good to be true. I couldn't have been more wrong! Plesser's price was competitive with the big box stores, and the shipment arrived a full week ahead of schedule. The box was in perfect shape on the outside, resulting in the dishwasher being in perfect shape when we took it out of the box to inspect. I couldn't be happier with my experience with Plesser's, and would recommend them to anyone! Job well done!",2021-03-26T01:03:21.000Z

It was because the bottom front of the oven was dented during delivery....at some point prior to the deliverymen unloading the oven from the truck at our house.

Extremely unhappy with AM Transportation & Plesser's,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered 2 refrigerators from Jennifer O'brien. She provided good service. My order didn't arrive for a long time, She told me items were on backorder. No problem on that. I had to wait much longer than expected and still had no problem. I had GOLD delivery which states service to choose your room. I was told by the sales person they will remove the old refrigerator and put the new one in.The Delivery from Am Transportation was a nightmare. Each person had a different story about delivery. I called Plesser's and got 2 different answers from 2 different staff members. Delivery company staff said one thing one day and the day of delivery I got a different answer. They even scheduled delivery without my ok and wanted to charge me $75 a reschedule fee. I called Plesser's delivery department and told me I have to deal with the delivery company.The Person who came to deliver told me another thing.He was ready to drop 2 refrigerators at my front door and leave.I paid extra $20 to the delivery company on the phone to remove the old refrigerator door.I pleaded with the delivery man to put the both refrigerators where they belong.It was a pretty easy delivery.  No stairs in the house. He hooked the kitchen fridge to the existing water line with a quick connect which took him under 2 minutes. He could not connect the 2nd fridge to the water line which was there. I still have to hire another person to connect the 2nd refrigerator to the water line.I had to tip him $150 with gold delivery and $20 to the delivery company.He left all the boxes and everything by my front door. He left the old fridge door in pieces. I hired one person to put old refrigerator's pieces together.I had to hire another person to break the boxes and clean up after them.

After telling the salesman that it has to be a 29""downdraft slide-in stove and  fit between granite countertop, he assured us that it would fit.  I asked him three times to send someone to measure the opening but he said it will fit because all downdraft  slide-in stoves are the same size.The salesman should have known his products he is selling.  After waiting because of covid related slowdowns, we finally got a delivery date for a February day at 7 o'clock am.  And surprise the stove did not fit!!   The delivery guy knew right away that it wouldn't fit and also mentioned it was his third one this week that didn't fit.

However, there delivery company that they use is terrible. I paid extra for the Gold Delivery service and  the drivers always tell me I didn't pay extra. They are lazy and rude. The last 2 times I have received an order, they do not want to bring it upstairs.  The first time I told them if they were not going to bring it upstairs then take it back, the SOB's then left it in the driveway and took off, one them actually coming after me. So I was left with a refrigerator, range, micro and dishwasher basically in the street. I had to call friends just to help me get it in the garage.I just, this week received another full appliance order and it was the same thing, although this time I told them to take it back and they did.

"Good prices, lousy shipping and delivery",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Until I called the store and spoke to a salesperson, the communication on refrigerators availability and estimated shipping dates for online order were wrong. Then comes the shipping fiasco. I ordered two fridges. On the smaller one, I got a phone call for the first shipping attempt. And then they were a no show and no follow up as if nothing happened. Shipping rescheduled for the next week. No notification on the rescheduled date. We got a text that delivery is on the way! A single delivery person showed up and determined he could not deliver by himself. Another week for the final delivery. Again, we only got a text when delivery was on the way. Then comes the big built in fridge. No phone calls and no arrangement for delivery time. We just get a text that delivery is on the way. I guess the delivery company just assumes everyone is at home and they don’t need to ensure there is someone home to receive. Even thought the prices we paid were competitive, the shipping arrangements and lack of installation service makes you think again to go with same remote seller again.",2021-03-04T22:36:25.000Z

There were no less than 4 rescheduled delivery dates and no less than 10 phone calls made between Plesser’s and the worst delivery company you could imagine. There were nothing but excuses and empty promises made after each call. To say that we were upset, is an understatement. I will say that Plesser’s Appliance did refund the shipping costs after I asked vigorously for some compensation. We will see if the delivery company will make amends by refunding me for lost wages when I took off work to receive the range and they rescheduled the delivery without consulting me at all.",2021-02-26T03:53:59.000Z

Plessers gets to five stars  and Bosch gets four…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Plessers gets to five stars  and Bosch gets four . Plessers is an excellent company I cannot complain. I was nervous that this process during covid-19 would be screwed up however plessers did an excellent job. Plesser's did everything they said they would and I'm only waiting on a Visa gift card for the rebate of In-House delivery service. This process takes six to eight weeks and it's only been two so no big deal. The Bosch dishwasher 800 dries very well, cleans most dishes but it is a pain in the butt to load dishwasher. The way the tines are bent makes it difficult to put large dishes and fit them underneath the second rack which is adjustable. If I adjust a second rack all the way up most of my normal size cups hit the Third rack. This dishwasher dries better than the whirlpool but I could stuff my old whirlpool with dishes much quicker and easier ... and as long as I could get it to latch it would clean the dishes just as well. Furthermore if you don't load it the way Bosch suggests, dishes don't come out nearly as clean. Just compromises a lot of space. Dishes do not really fit and mine are not that fancy. Good luck! The form follows function Fight Continues for me.",2021-02-25T23:55:51.000Z

The only reason they get a four star rather than a five star is because of the delivery service.  Twice we've purchased for a place that is 1 1/2 hours from our home.  I've asked that they call or text 2 hours prior to delivery so I can get there.  Now I understand that they can't be exact with their times and if they are off even an hour it's not a big deal.  But BOTH deliveries they called 10 minutes before arrival!

Credit also to Stephanie Ericsson for working out the two rebates I had coming. She intervened when Peter was out took the time to process the on line requirement which I was having problems with. It was significant totaling 750 dollars. She was great a real people person concerned with the customer. Thanks again Stephanie!

I ordered 5 kitchen appliances in mid October for a remodel I was doing, and was told it would take 8-10 weeks to get the appliances.  Ok.  But then in early December, I was told the appliances shipped.  Great I thought, because how long could that take for them to go from NJ to Baltimore?  Apparently with Plesser's shipper, it takes 5 weeks to travel less than 200 miles.  Which I don't believe, so I'm guessing that they didn't really ""ship"" when they said they did.  Then the shipper kept stonewalling me about where the appliances were and when they would be delivered.  I finally got Plesser's involved, and suddenly the shipper was ready to deliver.  I received the appliances 12 weeks after ordering, which was not great, and Plesser's gave me a discount for the shipping troubles.  Then it appeared we missed the deadline for some rebates because of the delayed shipping times, but Plesser's made sure we still qualified.  Finally, the refrigerator had a dent in the door, and Plesser's made sure the door was replaced quickly and easily.  So in the end I would recommend Plesser's if time doesn't matter, because they had great prices.  But if time does matter, find a local place to buy.",2021-02-17T02:46:05.000Z

2 Major problems forever loses my…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"2 Major problems forever loses my business!1.  I ordered 3 appliances in late October 2020. Less than 30 later, Plesser’s had a lower prices on their own website. I called to get the better price. Was told this is done through a “Customer Service” ticket. Entered all the pricing details that day. Received an email response saying it was received (Ticket # TT11048). Asked about this ticket a couple times when asking about delivery status & was told it is in the system. When 2 of the appliances were ready to ship in December, I asked why the price protection was not included. Was then told Customer Service did not process the ticket & Plessers could no longer get that pricing. Plessers would not honor my customer service ticket even though it was 100% their team not executing the process. I was told I could cancel the order if I didn’t like their decision. After waiting 2 months due to manufacturer delays, I couldn’t wait any longer by ordering from someone else. This is how they treat a customer who has purchased 8 appliances in the past 3 years prior to this purchase.  This company used to be honorable, but there have obviously been some poor management choices. Enjoy the few hundred extra dollars because you’ll never receive another dollar from me or get any additional referrals. 2. My credit card was charged twice for the down payment. Plessers never contacted me that they charged me a second time. Said they never received the first payment. My credit card company gave the exact dates & times of the 2 payments. Plessers told me to ask the credit card company to reverse the 1st payment because they never received it. I did that.

At that time there was an in stock model (JennAir) that fit my dimensions, but more expensive (dispensers on outside). I opted to wait the month for an additional model to be ordered.

Each time there was a delay I was only notified because I called each time. Never once was I proactively reached out to- I understand you can’t control the manufacturing demands - but, on the other hand transparency is expected throughout the buying process, especially with the purchase of expensive items, such as appliances. Now I’m expected to (hopefully) receive in mid-March, but I’m still unsure if this date is guaranteed.

Being from California, we were freaked about buying from an unknown seller across the country. And there were a lot of shady sites that came up in our search. But one phone call with Eugene at Plesser's and we were sold. He was honest, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and not the least bit pushy.

I was suspicious of ordering my Bosh…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was suspicious of ordering my Bosh Dishwasher from a unknown company to me (Plessor’s) that was located in New York.  The problem was my local Lowes (Southlake, TX)  was unable to get the appliance delivered timely that I had ordered and was continually being pushed further and further out on a arrival date.  My local Lowes order was over 60 days old when the email came that the “new arrival date” would be another 90 days out, making the original order over 140 days waiting.  Unacceptable, so I canceled the order and received my refund due.   I shopped online for another vender and found Plesser’s.  I spoke with Barry, one of the sales associate, and he assured me they had the dishwasher I wanted and it would arrive with in three weeks.  I took the plunge and ordered.  Everything went EXACTLY as Barry said it would go.  I received the dishwasher on time, the unit was brought into the house (slight added charge that I had agreed to), unboxed and the left over packing placed in my garage for removal by my local trash.  The dishwasher is awesome and I would highly recommend Plesser’s.  I even saved on my local state tax.  I would purchase again in the future.",2021-01-08T23:00:48.000Z
Damaged appliances,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I decided to order appliances from Plesser's because they had far and away the best pricing and a good reputation. Unfortunately, I live in southwestern Utah and I don't think Plesser's is prepared to ship to such a remote area. Two out of three of the appliances I ordered arrived damaged - one so bad it couldn't be repaired at all, and the other item, a Samsung refrigerator, had a damaged door, but there are no appliance repair shops in my area that would repair Samsung appliances. Plesser's ended up sending us a new refrigerator door and my husband replaced it himself. I think Plesser's needs to reconsider shipping across country, or they need to get better shipping agents. The bottom line is, if you live outside the Northeast, I don't recommend purchasing from Plesser's.",2021-01-08T22:49:46.000Z

A New Happy Customer...Plesser’s Made it Easy!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I had been researching the Bosch BCM8450UC Built-In Coffee Maker for quite some time. I liked Plesser’s detail for this appliance on their website. Their information was clear about sales process and tracking order. Plesser’s pricing was competitive when I considered all my options for purchase. I was impressed with a followup call I received from Plesser’s checking on my order status, informing of process, and offering additional warranty options.  On such a large purchase, it eased my mind knowing I would be fully covered if anything should happen ahead.  Item took a while for the appliance to finally arrive, but I had a clear status along the way.  It arrived in excellent condition.  I can share that for this being my first Plesser’s Appliance purchase, I am very impressed with the process from browsing the site, to purchase, and all the way through to delivery.

The impact of Covid on the Appliance industry.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's has always had the best price. I have used them many times for my home renovations as well as my personal residence. Covid has impacted all supply chains for appliances, so I was not pleased when I purchased what the website showed as in-stock items that were in fact not in stock. The refrigerator was backordered for months. I would suggest Plesser's I.T. department make the website a real-time view of actual inventory. The delivery company was problematic in providing an insurance certificate to my Condo association prior to delivery.  The trucking company does not take away the pallets, boxes and packing material which proved challenging for me to dispose of in a Condo.

Unacceptable all around...,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought and paid for a top end Bosch dishwasher on 9/1/20 through a sales rep. Was told it would be 6 weeks to deliver due to COVID. I understood that and patiently waited for its arrival. Three months later it arrived just prior to Christmas thankfully. However, after having it installed the same day by a professional it was discovered to have a broken wheel on the top drawer. No big deal I thought and contacted Plesser’s to inform them and they said they would arrange to have a replacement drawer sent out promptly. As it was only the top cutlery drawer I didn’t worry about not using that part until the new one arrived, which btw never arrived. I did also notice that the door also seemed “sticky” on one side and didn’t open smoothly. I thought it was just part of the design, but now I wonder if it was dropped in transit.A day later it was sufficiently full enough to run the very first load. Admittedly I was excited to see how it performed. Half way through it stopped, and when I went to investigate I found an e15 error message and I couldn’t restart it, and the dishes were a soapy mess within. Had the installer come back out promptly to see why, and he said I looks like a problem with the pump (possibly cracked) and was leaking into the bottom pan, which he felt was an unacceptable issue and I needed to contact Plesser’s, which I did. I was told by Plesser’s  there would be a call from Bosch to make an appointment to come out and “look” at it. Two weeks later no contact so emailed Plesser’s again to inquire about the delay. Was told they would reach out to Bosch ASAP to get them out ASAP. Another two weeks and I have still not heard from Bosch. Now we have a very expensive, albeit nice looking “lemon” in our kitchen which we haven’t been able to use even once. Not to mention having to unload and hand wash all the dishes already loaded prior to its first run. Have had to deal with Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years and every day doing every dish by hand, while Plesser’s has had our money for 4 months! I had initially asked them if they could make sure a new one was brought with the person from Bosch in case it couldn’t be fixed, as per the installer’s advice, so we wouldn’t have to wait anymore than necessary, as we had already waited three months of them having our cash and nothing to show for it. But no, they feel we should stand by and wait longer until Bosch pulls their finger out and makes this disaster string out even longer for us, without higher management intervention. Very disappointing to say the least. The person I have been dealing with has been pleasant and professional, but obviously higher authority is now needed but seems invisible.So, $1200 and 4 plus months later we are still without a dishwasher. Thanks Plesser’s...NOT.I understand COVID has made many differences in all of our lives, and we also have been affected greatly by its presence. However, as a sole caregiver to an elderly 91 year old combat war veteran with a heart condition, I feel the need to be able to sterilize his dishes properly, which is why I chose this model in the first instance.",2021-01-07T02:39:37.000Z

I bought $6700 worth of appliances and should have received a $200 rebate.  I submitted the rebate, called to confirm and with both orders was told I was eligible by all sales and customer service people I spoke with.  6 months after submitting and requesting the status of my rebate, the accounting coordinator contacted me via email and said that some brands do not qualify for the delivery rebate (this is a Plessers rebate not a mfg rebate) so I was ineligible.   If not eligible OK, but to be told when buying the products that I am eligible, reconfirming with other staff members and being told I would receive it, and then being denied after the appliances are delivered and I cannot do anything about it is unacceptable.  Also, why send me the rebate forms for my appliances if I am ineligble?  I wrote back and complained so will see if they respond.

Skeptical of ordering from NY and having it shipped NC, but desperate, we decided to try it.Our sales rep, Ryan, was great!  The much needed refrigerator was in stock and was shipped within a week.  Arrived before it’s scheduled date and in time for the Christmas Holiday.  When we get to the kitchen remodel, planning on a Plesser’s order.",2021-01-05T15:43:13.000Z
Initial experience with the purchase…,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Initial experience with the purchase was ok.   After that horrific communication untill I began to get angry and pester customer service.  After that much better at getting back to me.  However It should never have gotten to that point.  Had a warranty claim less than a week after receiving new appliance.  We couldn't use this appliance untill it was fixed and its something we could go without. Instead of Plessers arranging service for us we were told to call ourselves and they provided the numbers for two third party repair shops.  One never answered or returned the call.  The other didn't have an avaliable appointment for over 1 month.  So fed up with the level of service we called the manufacturer ourselves.  Explained we couldn't use the appliance because of a gas smell.   Even though they also had a backlog for 1 month the sent someone the next day.  Parts were ordered and within 5 days it was fixed.  I feel Plessers couldn't be bothered to lift a finger to help us instead they left us to handle it ourselves.  Not something I would expect from a place that sells high end appliances such as we had purchased.,2021-01-05T15:28:22.000Z

We are very dissatisfied Plesser’s and Speed Queen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We are very dissatisfied Plesser’s and Speed Queen customers. On November 17, 2020, we were happy to support a local business rather than a big box appliance store when we visited Plesser’s and purchased a new Speed Queen clothes washer and a dryer, both electric with 3 prong outlets, to replace our existing Kenmore appliances. The earliest available delivery date was December 2, 2020.  On that date Plesser’s delivery team removed the Kenmore units and installed the Speed Queen units which powered up. Later that day and early the next day, after running the dryer on different settings we discovered that while the motor turned, no heat was generated and the timer did not work.  On December 3, I left two voice mails and sent one email to Plesser’s advising them of our problem.  Later that day, I spoke with a Plesser’s representative who told me that the problem was a warranty repair issue and that I should deal directly with Speed Queen.  He gave me their “800” number. I called and spoke with a Speed Queen rep who told me that this was a Plesser’s issue since they took our money, they should service the machine they delivered.  Thereafter, I was bounced back and forth between Speed Queen and Plesser’s with neither taking the lead and solving the problem which left us without a working dryer for twelve days. I was and remain furious.On December 5, a technician sent by Plesser’s arrived at our home and spent several hours taking the dryer apart. He could not get the dryer to generate heat or the timer to work.  He advised that Speed Queen should send a new timer, a new fabric selector and a new wire harness.  He also advised that maybe there was a problem with our wall outlet- although we never had an issue with the outlet in powering our Kenmore dryer.In order to move things along and to make sure we did not have a power problem, our electrician checked out our electrical delivery from the circuit box to the dryer outlet-all was fine but the dryer still did not generate heat and the timer did not work.  They advised that the problem was the dryer. Before dealing with Speed Queen and Plesser’s further, in an excess of caution, I asked the electrician if there was anything more we should do on our end. He suggested installing a new four prong outlet and replacing the whip provided by Speed Queen and Plesser’s.  We did so at a cost of $239 and the dryer was still broken.I continued to advise Speed Queen and Plesser’s of our frustration at being almost two weeks without a dryer. On December 14, another technician arrived at our home sent by Speed Queen. He inspected the dryer and advised that a 120v spade connector inside the dryer was not connected. He restored the connection and the dryer heated and the timer worked. He advised that the problem should have been identified and corrected at the times of the Plesser’s installation and repair attempt.My complaint is against both Speed Queen and Plesser’s. For the better part of two weeks, we were without a dryer because Speed Queen manufactured a defective dryer which Plesser’s installed without making sure it was in working order. Speed Queen then pointed the finger at Plesser’s saying that they were responsible even though Plesser’s sold us a defective machine that Speed Queen had manufactured ? - a dubious proposition at best which left us hanging without immediate relief. And then the Plesser technician failed to fix the problem!Accordingly, we have no intention of doing business with Plesser’s or Speed Queen again.  Our dissatisfaction is that neither Speed Queen nor Plesser’s reached out to compensate us for our horrible experience, including incurring a $239 expense from our electrician which we incurred at the recommendation of the Plesser technician.We did get a call from Plesser’s advising that they were sending us a $100 Amazon Gift Card.Plesser’s continues to disappoint in profound ways-they sent a Plesser’s gift card instead.",2021-01-03T18:26:32.000Z

Bad Service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"When we initiated this purchase you told us 6 week until delivery; we accepted that condition.  During that period you said you needed more time, that turned out to be 5 more week(September 14th, 2020 until November 27th, 2020)After completing the sales process on November 27th, 2020; I was given tracking info that was useless.   To complicate matter you sent the item by an unreliable shipping company.  Whenever I tried to determine where the item was, all I got back was “intransist.”  That response was the same for 3 1/2 weeks.  It required my persistent calling for it to be specially located.  Then a promised date was given(December29th, 2020). When the time promised came around, no one had the professional courteously to inform us that there was a change in delivery date.  I was waiting , then calling, having to wait extended periods of time to get an acknowledgement, to be to told the delivery will be an  additional 9 days later(January 07th, 2021).Despite complaints as to the extensive delay in receiving my merchandise, delay is all I was offered. No real effort was taken to accept responsibility for this gross dereliction of duty to fulfill your obligation to deliver my property.  It is taken from September 14th, until still not delivered, hopefully 1-07-2021, to complete this transaction. No acceptance of responsibly and cost has truly been shared by the delivery company or Plessers for this.  Covid-19 is scapegoat, and we have had to suffer this  inconvenient  and burden in this process. It was us, the paying customer!

Well Worth The Wait!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Back in August when I decided to buy a new stove and thought it would be “so easy“ to find one, the hardest part was trying to find a business who wanted to help me over the phone. I called in my own area which is the state of Washington, and couldn’t find anyone who wanted to take my money. I had people who would not call me back, I had people tell me on the phone “I’m helping a customer I’m busy“, so I decided to go online and look for an appliance store outside of my own state. I was looking for a particular oven that I had fallen in love with, and every website said it was not available until October. I wanted to find out if there was one in stock anywhere in the United States. I happen to call Plesser’s, and spoke to someone who actually wanted to talk to me on the phone and wanted to take my money. I got the best customer service over the phone and fantastic communication throughout the waiting period. I even saved $500 by ordering it from Plesser’s, so it worked out even better. I finally received my oven in December, and it was well worth the wait. Sad that I had to spend money outside of my own state, but customer service was extremely lacking here, but not lacking at Plessers. I will definitely call them for my next appliance, even if I have to wait a little longer for it!",2021-01-01T19:56:13.000Z

My sales associate, Jennifer O'Brien, was so professional and competent that in a world of incompetence, I was simply amazed and impressed, but remained skeptical that everything from the great price, the shipping, and the rebate would actually happen like she said it would. It did. My refrigerator was delivered, unscathed, 140 miles, for free, by professional movers within 7 days, and my rebate check arrived 7 days after that. Simply amazing. Thank you Jennifer, and everyone at Plesser's. It is such a joy to see a company that makes thing happen like clockwork. All the best to all of you.

None of my local appliance suppliers (big box or otherwise) could get both or even one of the machines for at least 3 months. I found 2 suppliers online that showed to have in stock and was going to go with the other supplier until I read reviews. While Plessers was $100 more,  all of the review sites I looked at (including the BBB) rated Plessers much higher. Most of the negative reviews for Plessers were customer responsibility or outside vendor issues. I purchased my appliances just before thanksgiving and they were delivered in about 2 weeks without damage or incident. Installed them last week and they have worked perfect from the moment we plugged them in.

Needless to say the delivery guy instructed me that he would not be doing the conversion and that I would have to wait until Monday because nobody was available the day of the delivery which was a Saturday. So my range sat in the middle of the floor. I then had to take a day off from work on Monday. They didn't come until close to 4pm. The gentlemen that came was nice however when he opened the conversion kit there were pieces missing so he could not convert the whole stove. It took 2 weeks for my range to be fully operational. I paid over $19,000 for a dual fuel (Natural gas/convection) range. Wasn't told or given the option of accepting a stove that needed to be converted.

"The buying experience was great, the delivery left much to be desired",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"The buying experience was great.  I knew I wanted a specific model of refrigerator which I couldn't get locally so I shopped and bought it online from Plesser's.  Their price was good, delivery was free, and they upgraded it to gold for $75.00.  The delivery company AM Trucking was more of a problem.  Once I was notified that it was delivered to the local warehouse in the Carolina's, I contacted them to make sure that they were not bring a huge truck as I love in a mountain community.  Also, I upgraded the gold delivery to include installation and haul away of an old refrigerator.  They assured me that they had added it to the order and that they use a 26' truck which is ideal for our area.  The initial delivery was scheduled for Nov. 19.  The delivery truck was an Enterprise rental, with a temporary crew that had no tools, or orders to install or haul away the old unit.  They also weren't comfortable driving in the mountains and were afraid to back down our driveway.  They also complained that the standard size 36"" refrigerator weighed 420 lbs. and was too heavy for two people.  One of the movers complained that he had hurt has back on the previous delivery and that they weren't paying for his medical bills.  in the end, I had no confidence that they would even be capable of installing the new unit or moving the old one out.  I had them set the new Unit, unopened, in the original shipping box in my garage.  I contacted AM Trucking and told them what happened and they said they would arrange for another crew to come and complete the installation and remove the old refrigerator.  The new date was scheduled for Tues. Nov. 24, I again called AM Trucking to confirm that this time it would be a 3 man crew after telling about the previous failed delivery.  They assured me everything was in order.  Tuesday the 24th, another 2 man crew arrived who seemed competent,  but they also said that this was a 3 man job, and that they would make sure to let their manager know.  I waited till Friday after Thanksgiving to call AM Trucking to schedule the 3rd installation attempt, the agent told me it looked like Monday the 30th, but couldn't confirm until everything was set.  On Monday, I still hadn't heard back so I called AM trucking once more, and was told the next available date was on December 7.  I called Plesser's to update them and they intervened with AM Trucking and got us on the schedule for Dec. 2nd. which was the last time we could do it since we were leaving for Florida on the 4th. The 2nd arrived and we were kept informed by the delivery crew of their location and ETA.  They said they were a 2 man crew, but that moving the units and installation would be no problem.  They arrived on time, and accomplished everything perfectly.  I want to commend these two men from AM Trucking that accomplished the supposedly impossible move. Larian David McNeil and Andrew Howard.  I plan on writing to AM Trucking about them directly.  I also want to commend Patrick McGuire and John DeSenso from Plesser's for putting pressure on AM trucking in order to make it happen.  And now I can finish by saying I love my new Café Refrigerator.",2020-12-18T15:40:57.000Z

Was advised several weeks later that the dishwasher we wanted was no longer available and to choose another one. Then came time for delivery. Weeks went by and finally was advised that one of our ovens had been damaged and needed to be replaced. A partial shipment was made. Carrier came after dark, backed into house, causing brick wall between garage doors to fall. Men could not move refrigerator into kitchen, everything else was put in garage and not opened. A week later another truck came with the replacement over and orders to pick up the damaged oven. We never received the damaged oven. They also were not given instructions that refrigerator had to be moved to Kitchen. These guys were fantastic! They were able to move the refrigerator, unlike the first truck men, the also opened the appliances that the first truck delivered and we discovered the microwave was damaged. In summary, the people at Plesser were great, but the experience with the truck backing into our house, not getting refrigerator into kitchen, and late finding that our microwave was damaged is the reason for the poor rating.",2020-12-18T14:10:16.000Z

Took forever but we finally did get it.Also the delivery was fine, however the guys left the box the fridge was in on the side of my house and didn't tell me (It;'s a huge box).  It sat out there for 2 days before I noticed.  I'm glad my HOA didn't fine me.  This falls on the delivery company Plesser's contracted out, so still not on them as far as I'm concerned.The fridge arrived with a slight manufacturers defect.  Plesser's resolved the issue promptly, which is why they are getting 5 stars from me.  Happy overall with the price and the communication with Plesser's during the long 6 month wait.I would do business with them again in the future.",2020-12-17T01:20:24.000Z

I was told I would receive a call the next day, which was now 5 days ago and no phone call.

Tech was called and it took them a week to get to me.  I called Presser's and they were NO HELP in getting the date moved up and by this time the freezer was turning on and off like a carnival ride.  Beeping continuously day and night. Plesser's customer service still did nothing and I stopped calling them. Fisher Paykel beats Presser's in their incompetence as I still do not have an operating freezer.

Gas range was so damaged but still shipped,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered my refrigerator and gas range in August.  By Thanksgiving, I had not heard anything regarding delivery and only then I was told they could not fulfill the order for the refrigerator but the gas range would be delivered in December.  My account was charged for the 2 appliances and even though I've asked repeatedly for a confirmation of credit to my card, I still don't have it.  Last night, after 4 months of anticipating delivery of my range, it was delivered so badly damaged that glass and parts were spilling out of the box.  How someone was able to load that appliance on the truck knowingly in that condition is shameful!!!  Customer service practically blamed me for ""denying shipment"", they, as well as the rep were unsympathetic and very unaccommodating to find me an immediate replacement product to satisfy the order.  So now, well after 4 months of my purchase and a completed kitchen remodel, I'm having to place appliance orders elsewhere with the hope I can get them here in one piece.  Again, after repeated calls this morning, no confirmation of my credit. Plessers is great to immediately charge your account, but shady with giving you confirmation of your credit.  Whoever loaded my stove on that truck with the front of the box turned away from your view as it was loaded and unloaded on the truck to hide the damage, needs to be FIRED!  There is not an acceptable excuse to justify shipping it in that condition!  Who does that?",2020-12-09T18:10:06.000Z

Really easy to order online, you get a personal call to review your invoice and updates are sent via email as much as there are updates. The trucking service they use is fine as well. Pretty easy.The reason for 4 stars is because of a small misstep. Because we called during a special holiday, we were told that we would get white glove- where they would setup the fridge for us free (no upgrade charge). The system never put this in properly, and I never looked closely enough. The person who called seemed experience and very forward thinking so I did not do my usual check it twice. Well, the fridge came, we only had a gold package..where they leave it in the room and it is up to you to hook it up. Fortunately, we were able to do this but there was a lot of confusion and disappointed with this.So double check the order form and triple check it to make sure it has everything you discussed over the phone with the customer service representative.",2020-11-18T15:45:13.000Z

It took 4-5 days for them to pickup from the warehouse and about 15 days to reach the other coast. Then it sat in the distribution center for another 6 days right here in California. Not a pleasant experience, especially since it was a dishwasher and we have been without one for over a month.Unless they change the shipping company or provide better shipping experience, we would not order again.",2020-11-12T23:11:27.000Z

I didn’t like how they rolled appliances with my bumpy driveway so I hope I didn’t getany scratches and dents on the appliances just I am crossing the my fingers hopefully it is not the case. I store the appliances inside the house and not installing them until I finish with cabinets than I will find out if I have any scratches and/or dents with the appliances. All this hassle could be avoided if the driver of the truck is better trained and customer service oriented person. He was unprofessional and not show any care of customer service and not care of his job. Also big negative he was not wearing the mask so we are middle of the pandemic why you putting me in risk not wearing mask. I help them on the down of the sliding door to raise the appliances, I could easily could expose the virus if they had it. Delivery service is bad with this rude truck driver they employed. He is unprofessional and rude. In store experience outstanding but come on Plesser’s you can do better with delivery service. Just fire this truck driver and hire someone new to do job properly and professionally. I recommend Plesser’s but you have to make open your eyes ten times bigger when they delivery service comes to your door.

I contacted Plesser’s on Monday,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I contacted Plesser’s on Monday, 10/12 at 1:00pm to request service on my new LG washer because the spin cycle was not extracting all the water from the clothes. I received a response shortly after saying that someone from Customer Support would be in touch with me. Shortly after, I received another sympathetic text saying someone would contact me shortly. Nobody contacted me that day, and it was impossible to reach anyone by phone. Human contact from Plesser’s was nonexistent. The following day I received a text from yet another person saying she was handling my concern. Later that day, after my complaining via text that I’ve been waiting for 2 days just to set up an appointment for a repair, she sent me an 800 number to call which happened to be LG service and a woman in the Philllpines assisted me.  She in turn was trying to assist me to trouble shoot the problem. I had to remind her that I was not the technician, that I was the CUSTOMER and I paid almost $2000 for a new washer/dryer and am having nothing but aggrevation. Eventually she set up an appointment for a week later to have a technician come to my house. Although I was very happy with the purchasing experience from Plesser’s, I was more than dissatisfied with the service and response to my needs.  I’ve only had the washer since the middle of September and not only is the service from Plesser’s abhorable, the arrogance in making me wait two days just to set up an appointment was unacceptable; and the fact that you cannot speak to a person is simply poor business practice.

DO NOT BUY KITCHENAID AND DO NOT BUY AT PLESSERS!!!My review of this appliance follows.This $2000 boat anchor hasn't worked since the day it was installed.  We have now had 5 ""Service Tech"" visits to try to fix it with more in the future. Still not working.They have changed boards, HMI, wiring harness, switches and it STILL DOESNT WORK!!!  I have spent hours of my time on the phone and babysitting these techs, and still it DOES NOT WORK!!!  They have taken this thing completely apart and it STILL DOES NOT WORK!!!I spent over $10,000 on Kitchen(no)ade appliances in my kitchen remodel. You would think after a couple trips they would apologize that I got the lemon microwave and order a new one for me. I dont care that it will take 8 weeks, 12 weeks to get here.

Their warranty is to slowly kill you with new parts and another 2, 3, 4 hours gone from my life.I've gotten as ""high as this goes, sir"" in calling Kitchenade  BEGGING them to put an end to this.  When I ask to go to the next level, the answer is ""you will have to write a letter"".  Last I checked this was 2020, right? AND they dont even have a person, po box, or department to send it to!

The sale and purchase of the appliance from Plessers in Babylon,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The sale and purchase of the appliances went well. Part of the sale was almost $800 in rebates which took me several phone calls and countless emails with the store to resolve an issue with their paperwork. The salesman did not want to know us after the sale was made and pawned us off onto another woman in a different department. This woman worked hard and was nice but it should not have taken 2 weeks for a paperwork issue on their end to be resolved. This took 2 weeks to resolve, once resolved I got the rebates in less than a week. Very frustrating for a simple process. The installation team was top notch, these guys were the best !!!!. In addition after spending over 5K on appliances they did not give us any samples of detergent or jet dry for the dishwasher or anything at all. We unfortunately had to buy a new washing machine and we went to another appliance store and they gave us detergent and fabric softener samples for our first few loads on them which we believe is normal as we have always gotten this stuff.It is the little things like customer service and samples to show appreciation for the sale to the customer that makes all the difference to us and they fell down on the job here.",2020-09-22T22:40:48.000Z

Similar issues but Plesser's seem to have the best supply and shortest delivery times (we'll see how that actually materializes). I had some questions on warranties and the like so I called their number and spoke to Barry. He was extremely knowledgeable and very professional and helpful. I could have not asked for a better conversation. I ordered the appliances right there and then.

Exceptional Sales Experience -  Couldn't be more pleased.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Following up a very strong recommendation from a close friend, who recently obtained his entire kitchen appliance package from Plesser's, I phoned them and reached Barry Rubin.Barry was extremely helpful in providing guidance to me, with his feedback on my recent researched choices for gas cooktops, as well as what purchase terms Plesser's can offer. Given his knowledge, friendly manner, and what I felt was his honesty and open transparency, I decided that Presser's would be my vender for this purchase, and called him back 2 days later. Working with me, before I made my final model choice, he even called later that day to inform me of a closeout on another model of the same manufacturer,  at considerable savings, that was just brought to his attention,. Needless to say, I immediately submitted my order.In summary, Barry was exceptionally professional, user-friendly, technically skilled, a pleasure to interact with, and most importantly impressed me as one who is sincerely focused on the best interests of a sincere consumer.  As a senior (not my first rodeo), I believe that Barry is a valuable asset to your sales team, and one that enhances Plesser's excellent reputation.Thank you.",2020-08-19T20:56:28.000Z

It’s been 3 weeks since placing an order with Plesser’s and it’s estimated that my washer/dryer may not arrive for another 3 weeks or more! Sure, they have a banner across the site saying there are “delays” due to COVID but that is the understatement of the year. Had I known it would have taken this long I would have spent the extra money and purchased from Home Depot or Lowe’s. I wish I could just cancel my order so that I can stop going to germ-infested laundromats, but they charge you for return shipping and restocking which is astronomical, and I can’t imagine how long that would take. I can’t emphasize enough how terrible this entire process has been, I will NEVER order from Plesser’s again!!",2020-08-17T11:28:40.000Z
Horrendous Customer Service and Warranty,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Wish I could give zero stars. Horrendous 3rd party warranty and customer service.  I bought a Bosch refrigerator as part of an appliance package with a 5 year extended warranty.  The fridge has not worked properly for over one year now.  (drawer fills with water and spills onto the  floor, produce/food goes bad, panels frost up) Warranty company says it wants to try to repair yet again (after several failed attempts) but now says I need to wait months for parts. Have  been trying to reach Plessers but they don't answer the phone or return my recorded or online messages. Bosch says they will not help because I purchased the extended warranty.  EDIT ADDED IN RESPONSE TO PLESSERS RESPONSE BELOW:   I have been working with the warranty company, A New Leaf,  for over one year and they have yet to resolve the issue. The first time the fridge started having problems I was told it was because a foot was missing. I was also told that even though the foot missing was the reason for the fridge not working properly, it was not covered by the warranty (because it was cosmetic.) So I had to get a new foot from Bosch myself and pay the repair shop to install it. This did not fix the issue.  The service provider came back and instructed me to defrost the entire fridge and rest. This also did not solve the problem. Then they finally ordered and installed some new parts.  The fridge continued to have problems. I told the warranty company I wanted  to try a different repair shop, They agreed and the new provider came out (after months of delays) and performed another repair but the fridge continued to have problems. I had to call New Leaf multiple times and wait for numerous weeks for returned calls and another appointment. Then after long delays not hearing about about what they would do to solve the problem I called escalations to hear back from  New Leaf and when I finally did they told me I would have to wait until July for the repair because a part was on back order.  However, the  service provider also called me and  informed me that the part would be in in October, not July.  They also insisted that they told New Leaf that the part would be in October, not July,  and that was too long to make me wait for the repair.  I spoke with an escalation department numerous times and requested to have the fridge replaced. I am now being told they only replace fridges after three failed  repairs for the same issue and theyclaim their paperwork indicates separate issues instead the same one all this time.  They also can't seem to locate the paperwork for the third repair from the second service provider.  Last time I spoke with them they offered to pay me $600 to cash out for a $2,500 fridge.  Plessers still does not return my calls or message.",2020-08-14T23:44:20.000Z

Ordered June 18th,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered June 18th. At that time they said it would be sent or picked up by their shipping company on the 24th. On June 25th they stated our order did in fact ship on the 24th. They stated they do allow 5-7 business days to get to transit hub which in my case is Davenport IA. At that time the shipper will contact me. On the 26th, I looked at AM Trucking tracking and it still stated as of the 24th it was still sitting in a warehouse somewhere. So I called the shipping company and they said Plesser's still hasn't authorized them to pick up yet (even though they told me it shipped on the 24th).  Shipping company then proceeds to tell me it might take a week for tracking to catch up. BTW, calling Plesser's or the shipping company takes waiting on hold for an hour to an hour and a half. I have done that 4 times now. And forget about the quicker response time by email because you won't get anything for 2 days and then they just state they will look into it. Fast forward to Friday July 17th. Shipper finally called and schedule delivery for July 21st. No call, no show. Sent another email threatening to cancel order. They finally sent a text and emaail stating that they have a delivery time open between 6PM and 10PM on the 24th. 10PM? Are you kidding me? On a Friday night? Told them that is not going to work as we are going out of town after work on Friday. Both these companies are a joke and I highly recommend not even bothering unless you want to give yourself a brain aneurysm. Pay a few bucks more and buy from someone else. Regardless, something I ordered a month ago, I still do not have and really don't have answers. One more thing, I copied and called Plesser's EVERY step of the way so they CANNOT use their shipper as an excuse, period. shipping company works for them, so its on Plesser's.Update: After I raised hell on this and the business bureau, the shipping company contacted me.

So after we went to a hardware store and purchased the the new water line, as we were told we needed to do, we hooked it up with the water source and the refrigerator. We then installed the refrigerator and leveled it off, as the instructions told us to do? We then unwrapped the refrigerator and opened it up, and to our surprise we found the water line in the Produce drawer. The instructions need to be updated to make buyers aware of the water line stored in the refrigerator, to save time and money for the buyer.

No support from Plessers.  see my previous postsOn going no product sagaJust an update. It has been over 1/4 of a year since I placed my order for 4 samsung appliances. April 17 was the order. 5 weeks later was the delivery (may 24) with 50% damaged. Today is July 28th and I don't have a dishwasher. Plessers passed the buck to the Manufacturer who has fiddled around. Last week I finally filed a dispute with the credit card company. Both Samsung and Plessers said: ""well, we will just have to close the file"". Still no dishwasher. Prices may be good but obviously in my case you don't get the product. I learned my lesson, local face to face is a better way to buy.",2020-07-30T12:45:15.000Z

"Product 4 Stars, Delivery 1 Star",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Revised July 24. Fridge arrived and was as stated. Delivery service left a lot to be desired. First - they scheduled a delivery time and showed up even though I didn’t confirm it (and it wasn’t actually a good time, but what do you do once they are there?)Second, I had paid for the fridge to be brought into the house, which I was first required to prove and then I was told that it wouldn’t fit through my front door. SERIOUSLY?! Front doors are a standard size, it’s not like it could possibly have been a surprise, but they argued that they couldn’t deliver it to the kitchen, even though I’d paid for it. I had to give them advice about what could be done to get the thing inside (which they did, complaining all the while). Finally, I thought I’d paid for Water hook up and removal of the box. When I needed to go inside to verify my confirmation e-mail, they just got into their truck and left. Not a huge deal, since they were right, but amazingly rude. So - to sum up. Verify your delivery options carefully, print the invoice with those options on it, and be prepared to fight for them to do what you paid for.",2020-07-24T19:10:23.000Z

Took almost 4 weeks and no proactive communication from Plesser or the delivery company as to the whereabouts of the shipment unless I inquired, which i had to several times  Still don't have a reason for the delay, which is very frustrating.  It seems the shipment arrived from manufacturer to delivery company and was not unloaded for at least a week to 10 days. We could have understood if given some reasonable explanation.

Luckily my contractor was able to put in outlets and installed both which again we were charged for by Plessers. 3) I realized the stove we ordered was a special order, however the rep failed to tell me that once final payment was made it would be another 6-8 weeks. Had I known I would have paid for it earlier!! Also, once again my contractor had to move gas valve for stove to get flush with wall!! After installation my daughter noticed that on the stove one of the burner locations sign was missing, sent pic to rep, he never responded!  I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you're spending $$$ on a Viking stove you expect perfection!

I ordered another product using the same or similar warehouse in NJ on the same day using the same trucking company and received it on the 17th.On the 18th I called - and only got a VM so-called customer service and waited a long time to talk with a human. I spoke with a nice guy working from home. As a business owner, I understand this. He asked me to call transit again and leave another VM. On Fri at the end of day, I received a call back noting it had been followed up on and the product would arrive the following week. No follow-up.The week passed and nothing. No email, nothing. Tuesday 30th received an automated msg from transit company to hit one and confirm apt for the next day. July 1st for delivery.I received this review notice before the product had arrived and emailed you pointing this out,on the 28th. No one called me or emailed.It took over a month from placing my order to receiving the product?I understand being overwhelmed - but it is no excuse for lack of communication and follow-thru on an order.

Our shopping experience at Plesser's was a joy.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Our shopping experience at Plesser's the easiest time we've ever had purchasing major appliances. Kitchen reno. New Fridge, range, dishwasher, microwave and vent hood. In the Covid era, we were met at the store and were the only people besides our salesperson, Stephen who was VERY knowledgeable and accommodating. We were able to get exactly what we were looking for and to arrange delivery for future dates easily. Due to a contractor/cabinet designing snafu, our special ordered vent hood wouldn't work and they went out of their way to help us return the unreturnable hood. It saved us $1400 and a lot of headache. The deliveries, (3 separate) went off without a hitch and their delivery guys were all extremely respectful (again, Covid) and professional. I also ordered the wrong size microwave and had no problem getting a different one. I can't comment on the extended warranty because we haven't used it yet but the price was certainly reasonable. Overall, great experience and we will definitely be using them for any future purchases.",2020-06-30T13:15:52.000Z

Drove to the store and left with the impression that he was going to replace the fridge due to arrive in August.  I told him I could wait.  Yesterday I received an email stating He had reached out to the manufacturer and they had some escalating problems and there is nothing he could do for me.

West coast beware,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Typically I am not a person who leaves negative feedback. I order 5 appliances on May 23rd with the hopes of the order being delivered in early June. The order was shipped out June 4th and after MANY calls to customer service, delivered on June 22nd, roughly 2 weeks after promised.  Well this is were it gets more frustrating.  First, one of my appliances was not shipped with the other pieces based on availability, however I was not told that when ordering, in fact I was told all products were in stock.  Second, when the delivery showed up on the 22nd, my double oven was missing.  No one can find it.  I understand that it may be a shipping companies responsibility, however, this is who Plesser’s contract through so I don’t give them a reprieve.  Third, when I had the refrigerator installed, one of the internal water lines leak.  I have lived without major appliances for roughly 3 weeks now. Not once was I called proactively to help.  Every call has been initiated by myself. At this point, I would have gladly spent the extra few hundred dollars and ordered them through Lowe’s, Home Depot or Best Buy.

"Terrible service, not proactive when things go wrong",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Terrible service.  The price was the best we found anywhere and the delivery terms were awesome, but delivery was many weeks late.  Understand, the covid-19 pandemic has caused a lot of disruption, but this was a matter of Plesser's not being proactive.  We were told our fridge would take 2-3 weeks to deliver.  After more than 3 weeks I called them, only to be told it had been discontinued.  They gave us a good deal on an upgrade and were again told 2-3 weeks.  Again, over 3 weeks later, I called and they had no status.  A few days later I was contacted for delivery.  They use AM Home Delivery & Trucking outside their immediate area.  Awful service.  Completely automated, so when things go wrong, they go very badly, since there is no one to call.  Was given a 4-1/2 hour delivery window - they showed up 2 hours before the beginning of the window.  I had to cancel an appointment as a result.  Then I was constantly berated by the driver because they couldn't find our house and it was a big fridge, requiring door removal for delivery.  We have a 36"" entry door and the instructions on the front of the fridge clearly indicated the door would need to be removed.  Still, they tried everything they could to bring it in with the doors on, then finally gave up and removed them, then blamed me for how long it took.  It's amazing they did not badly damage the unit.  If you have a lot of time and don't care about delivery schedule, their prices can't be beat.  Overall, I would have paid far more to not be without a fridge for 6 weeks.",2020-06-12T18:53:27.000Z
Plesser's Appliance followed up with a…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Plesser's Appliance followed up with a replacement ice maker when the first one was delivered with damage.  They handled the problem quickly.  The only disappointment was the length of time it took to deliver the merchandise and of course the damage.  I was assured they would more securely pack the second shipment with extra care.  The second ice maker arrived with identical packaging as the first.  I guess I just got lucky on the second one or you could say I was just unlucky on the first one.  The moving company was AM Home Delivery & Trucking Company which seems to be close their location.  I would advise finding a better shipping company.,2020-06-12T18:49:37.000Z

Plesser's was fine to deal with but ...,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's was great but once the experience left Plesser's umbrella, it went a bit downhill. The refrigerator was supposed to be delivered on a Monday. Finally got a text on Wednesday night that it'd be delivered on Thursday morning. The text said that the refrigerator would be delivered but NOT installed unless I upgraded to ""White Glove"" service. I called to get upgraded and was told they weren't doing ""White Glove"" services due to COVID-19. The service rep said basically they'd put the 400-lb refrigerator in my garage and that was all they were required to do ... the rest was up to me. I'm older and not in the best of health and we just moved to a new city where I didn't know anyone who could help me move this. When the refrigerator was delivered, I asked the guys if they could put it in my kitchen and install it. They conferred with each other and said they could do it for $60. While I wasn't happy paying that on TOP of a delivery fee, it was the only choice I had. In the end, they tore a chunk out of my new wall (the driver called it a ""boo-boo"". My home was less than a week old at this point), they apparently threw the water tray away with the box and didn't even turn the water to the refrigerator on (not a big deal as the fridge is on wheels and I could move it out enough to do that). Again, Plesser's was fine but everything after them was unpleasant and made me wish I had dealt with local retailers instead.",2020-06-11T19:08:34.000Z

I researched and at least 3 other stores had the stove ( Ironically I was able to order the stove from Brandsmart and it arrived within the same week.  It was even $100 cheaper). Meanwhile, I was still waiting for the fridge from Plessers. It didn’t arrive for an additional 2 weeks.

Customer Representatives at Plesser…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Customer Representatives at Plesser were excellent, but the installation service was horrible.  My front door and door frames into kitchen have been damaged.  AMTrucking was contacted several times on the details of the refrigeration removal, installation, door removals, etc.  The customer service people did not communicate this information to the dispatch.  First dispatch decided to deliver the refrigeration without the removal and installation upgrade that I had been communicating with customer service for weeks.  The dispatch never called me to schedule.  They just scheduled it. Next after I paid for the removal installation upgrade, again dispatch didn't call me to schedule, they just scheduled it.  When the delivery people arrived they were not informed about the removed and installation upgrade.  They didn't have the tools and appeared to not have the skills. I mentioned to the delivery people twice that they probably should take the doors off of the refrigeration.  The upgrade I purchased included removing and adding the refrigerator doors.  But they decided they didn't need to take them off and instead they ruined my front door and casements.  In addition, the delivery people were very frustrated because dispatch did not tell them about the upgrade.  They didn't have the tools.  They borrowed my tools to deal with the refrigerators.  I don't think they knew how to take the doors off and back on.  In addition, they complained that they were 2.5 hours behind on their schedule.  Why didn't dispatch properly plan for this?1. They damaged the front door, front door casement, and both door casements going into the kitchen.2.  The new refrigerator water filter and ice maker is not working.3. The removal refrigerator door wasn't put back on properly and needs to be adjusted.I am very disappointed that AMTrucking doesn't communicate between customer service and dispatch.  I am disappointed that dispatch never called me to schedule.  I am disappointed that dispatch didn't properly plan for this upgrade with the appropriate personnel, tools, skills, and time scheduling.Overall, it is very disappointing.  Now I have to get estimates to get my door and casements fixed.  This is very time consuming.My take away is it will probably be better to hire a professional company to do the install and removal, so you don't get your house damaged.5 years ago, Sears came in, took the doors off the refrigerator, installed it with no issues whatsoever and I didn't even have to pay for an upgrade. Wow, things are really different with this company.",2020-06-10T22:03:58.000Z

Purchase easy but rest of process was a nightmare,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My sales associate Jennifer was great. Very accommodating and pleasant. The experience afterwards has been awful though. I purchased a fridge on May 15th with a 3-4 business day turnaround. So it was supposed to come the week before Memorial Day. Now one called me all week and then end of day Saturday I get a call that it will come by the 28th. Quite annoying and a little inconvenient that I would now have spoiled refrigerated goods and have to get takeout for multiple days but I let that go. Now come the 27th and the delivery people show up and tell me whoops your fridge is not on our truck right now. The depot will call you immediately and let you know when it will be out. I’m expecting this is something they will fix quickly. Now one calls me so I call them that night. They try to tell me oh sorry we only come out once a week so your going to have to wait till next week sometime. Completely unacceptable. You make an error twice and tell me oh it will probably come out sometime next week. So 3 weeks without a refrigerator and having to purchase a mini fridge. Now one from the delivery team to customer service really seems to care unfortunately. I don’t see how I would ever purchase from them again and they have a supposed good name with people where I’m from. *update* brought my fridge the 29th. Only one delivery guy came and told me he was going to have to drop it in my garage until next week until someone can get it inside. So I had to help him bring it in and complete all the unboxing myself. Paid for a delivery service and had to help complete the delivery of a 400 lb fridge. Not the drivers fault but come on Plesser’s you can do better. Disappointed,2020-06-05T21:13:15.000Z

White glove delivery - I THINK NOT!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,White glove delivery - I think not. Only put it where it was supposed to go would not install handles nor remove packing material.

My first experience with Plesser's Appliances.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"My issues were with the size of a replacement refrigerator.  The Plesser salesman did an excellent job of taking my kitchen door and counter top measurements over the telephone and then selecting the proper machine (one that would fit and would give me all the features I was used to) for me to meet my needs.  Everything went smoothly and I am well-pleased with both the sales, the service, the appearance of the new refrigerator.  I have always before been a GE customer and before purchasing a Whirlpool product -- I checked other reviews which pointed out some negative features such as the running noise made by Whirlpool refrigerators as well as the racket the ice maker makes when preparing new cubes.  I found none of these warnings to be accurate.  My new machine makes much less noise than my old one and the sound of the ice maker is well LOWER than any of the previous four machines I have had before.

After 3 scheduled deliveries and then being told there would be a 4th I called Bosch to find out what the problem was. They told me HD doesn’t stock this item and it wasn’t in the country yet. So I got my money back and researched some more finding Plessers. It was a lower price by $800, they were honest with me and said it was difficult to get then the pandemic hit. They called me and I understood it may be a while, I figured maybe by July if things went well. New York and New Jersey we’re hit bad, but to my surprise I got a email on May 1st saying it was in there warehouse and ready to ship out but May 8th. Well Monday I got a call and said if I was available I could have it Tuesday May 5th. Of course I would be home. But was I hearing this right?? Yes I was.

Then a week later with no confirmation, it is then acknowledge the item is not in stock, then fulfillment date shifts week to week. Order took weeks longer than initially stated. Also, the shipping vendor they used would not be my choice if there were options. Difficult to get information or status of shipment, slow with multiple transits, and ultimately my large appliance was delivered damaged. Plesser's could not provide an un-damaged replacement and because of the weeks of delays, the manufacturers sales that were active on item were expired causing unit to cost over $1000 from a local retailer than I could have purchased at time of original order.",2020-05-27T22:04:13.000Z

One of the pieces was damaged, a small dent in the refrigerator door, in shipping.  They have a great system for rectifying that.  A new part was ordered and it was installed today.

They did plug it in and install the refrigerator line for me, however, the refrigerator did not work. The insisted that they would not take it back and I had to wait for two days for a repairman to come. He told me that it did not have freon in it and it did not have a port for him to put freon in. So he would have to order the part and then still was not sure it would work. I called Plessers and at that point, they did refund my money.

Running into temp problems as flame keeps going out and called for help from your service department. They didn’t respond to two phone calls and an email last week. Heard from your service department yesterday asking me if I heard from Lynx about setting up an appointment to fix the problem I am encountering? I have not been contacted by Lynx. I am very disappointed And feel that your company is incapable of addressing my service issue on a timely basis. I recently placed an order at Plessers for two Miele dishwashers totaling 5k which I am on the verge of canceling if I don’t have my Lynx problems rectified. I am ver disappointed in the way the above has been handled. Thank you. Irwin Kruger 917.682.6872,2020-05-12T16:29:37.000Z

Unsatisfied Customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In the beginning of the transaction I was very pleased with the store appearance, selection of manufactures and the knowledge the sales person I had. I purchased a GE Profile oven and a Weber grill. The problem started after the delivery. The grill was delivered with missing parts ( the two shelf's on the side of the grill were missing nuts and bolts.     I called the store and was directed to a service person, that person took the information and ordered the parts need for the job. After a week, I got a call that the service people would be out and repair the grill. The servicemen came out and discovered they had the wrong parts. At this point I had the grill for over 3 weeks and I wanted to use the grill. I contacted the store and spoke with my sales agent (Eric) Once again I explained my issue, I told him that this was unacceptable and that the grill should be replace. Eric was very uncooperative and I felt like he was just appeasing me. At one point he even had the nerve to tell me that the unit he sold me was a floor model and that I should accept the way it was delivered to me. That was never discussed at the store and quite frankly if you are paying $650 for a grill it should be delivered in excellent shape. I was also told by Eric that he would investigate the issue and get back to me. To date I have not received a call from either Eric or the service department.    I would never had accepted this grill delivery in the first place but I was assured that Plesser's would fix this problem immediately.   I'm very surprised that a family owned business and a fixture in the community operates this way. Your sales team needs to be retrained and learn to deal with issues much better.    for your reference I purchased additional appliance elsewhere.",2020-05-11T16:40:53.000Z
Excellent all around,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Plesser’s was able to fulfill my order of a chest freezer for my garage and deliver it in a prompt and efficient manner.

I would still highly recommend them to anyone in need of appliances. Mark and Alan truly care about their customers and it’s evident in their attention to customer service. Far superior to the big box stores. Will be back for all of our appliance needs.,2020-05-11T16:31:25.000Z

Plessers did a great job. Shipping took a long time though.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Plessers did a great job when we ordered our stove. Unfortunately with everything going on our stove was delayed by many months. It also took some time for shipping as the shipper does not go direct to Phoenix. It took them about a week to get it to California and then another week or so to finally get it to Phoenix. The shipping company provided no clear tracking progress and when the stove never showed up on the date they indicated it would be delivered on I called them and they said it would be a few more days. Then they called and said it would arrive the next day so I took off the day so I could be there. When it didn't show up they finally called and said the driver was sick and it would come the next day. It finally arrived and the guys who unpacked it and brought it in were great and it looks beautiful. We are very happy with Plessers. It was just an extremely long wait to get it.,2020-05-06T19:57:26.000Z

You could do a lot better...,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Refrigerator arrived in perfect condition, grade = A+.  However the delivery service gets an F-.  They ripped off the carton and hauled the appliance up to our entry and dollied it to the center of the kitchen and left apparently mad at the inconvenience, without so much as a 'good-bye'.  When my wife and I tried to maneuver the frig to the wall the bottom of the appliance ripped large tears in our new linoleum. Only later we found the appliance instructions inside the unit which explained that the unit could only be moved if heavy cardboard was placed under the unit. Not an easy trick for 70-year old folks.The delivery service you hired sucks and there should be a warning to customers about moving the piece somewhere on the outside of the carton or unit. We are not happy clients. Steven White",2020-05-05T20:40:15.000Z

No delivery notice before arrival,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,The price and customer service was fantastic.  I give only 4 stars because the delivery company didn't notify us the day before delivery like they're supposed to.  They called 20 minutes prior to arriving so we didn't have any time to prepare.  They were very nice and helpful while they were here.  I did then receive an email about 30 minutes after they left.,2020-04-30T11:55:01.000Z
I highly recommend Plesser’s,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I highly recommend Plesser’s. I was ready to buy a kitchen aid double convection oven from a local retailer for over $4,100. Not including delivery.  I decided to look online. I found the same double oven at Plesser’s for 2,495. No shipping fee. It was delivered in less than two weeks during the Covid pandemic. Pretty impressive!!!  I also got a 10 year extended warrant free. That would have cost over $300 at my local retailer and it would have only been for 5 years.  I want to buy local, but for the price?  I figure helping someone on the east coast and saving $$$ is a win win!",2020-04-30T01:09:55.000Z

Plesser's referred me to Samsung, Samsung referred me back to Plesser's.  Honestly, other than this problem, it was a great experience, but someone needs to take responsibility for missing parts, and I can't get anyone from Plesser's to respond to my emails at this point.

Be Aware Customer Should Anticipate Having to Manage the Process,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The Plesser online ordering was easy, and I would give 4.0 stars.  The 1.0 star deduction is due to Plesser entering our phone number incorrectly on the order and then not correcting it when we notified them of the error.  The 3.0 star overall rating was due to the shipping company (we live in Illinois), which did not keep their website up to date for tracking the shipment; they were advised about the incorrect phone number and did not correct it until a second phone call to get the agent to enter it correctly; they did not reply to two emails or return phone calls; when they did finally call to schedule delivery they left no message on the answering machine and hung up.  Dealing with the delivery driver went very smoothly, and I would give 5.0 stars.",2020-04-29T15:30:47.000Z
Worst experience ever,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Worst experience ever.  Will never buy from this company again.  First I had to order my item by phone vice through their website, really it’s 2020.  Then I was told it would take 2 weeks to ship an in stock item.  I never received a confirmation email in my purchase and had to contact their “customer service” to find out the status of my order.  Purchased on 27 March did not receive until 17 April and I only live about 600 miles from their warehouse.  I had to continuously contact Plesser's for updates on my order status, tracking information etc.  I had better experiences ordering from catalogs in the 1980’s.  Garbage company and will never use them again. Oh and you can blame COVID-19 for a shipping delay, but not for poor customer service and overall inefficient processes.",2020-04-29T15:22:46.000Z

"Ordered a $3,000.00 Kitchenaid double…",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a $3,000.00 Kitchenaid double wall oven in March 2020 from Plessers.FIRST ISSUEThe installers did a fairly poor installation job when seating the oven in the kitchen cabinet. (Note that this was replacing a 16 year old version of the same oven, same manufacturer, same measurements)  The new oven was installed with the top Console sticking out at an angle with a 1/8 inch gap between the unit and the cabinet.  It's designed to be a flush mount unit as was the old one.When they returned to fix that, they intially claimed that is how the oven is designed to fit, with the entire top console sticking out at an angle with a 1/8"" gap.  When I would not accept that answer, they pulled the oven out and respositioned it in less than 5 minutes.  So much for it being ""manufacturer design""!SECOND AND WORST ISSUETheir installers left a Black plastic/Nylon Cable Zip Tie in the back of the top oven cavity.  The oven was run at high temp for 30 minutes at the installers instructions in order to burnoff whatever manufacturing residue is in the oven.  It prduced a noticeable smell and smoke which was expected.Then we did not use the oven for a few days.  When we did begin to use it, the smell never seemed to go away, but we still assumed it was residue burnoff.  After a few more days, the smell seemed to get worst and we then noticed some smoke in the back of the oven cavity.  That's when we noticed the melted remains of a black plastic cable zip tie in the back.  By now it had fused onto the enamel coating on the bottom of the oven and could not be removed by hand.   Fearing it was a fire hazard, not to mention potentially poisonous fumes, we had no choice but to forceably remove it.  This resulted in the plastic coming off in pieces and taking some fo the blue enamel coating with it.  The enamel coating is actually stuck to the bottom of the melted tie wrap.  To this day, there is still some of the melted tie wrap stuck to the oven cavity.Upon contacting Plessers Customer Service, we were told multiple times on different phone calls over a week with the same rep, that they took no responsibility for the damage to to the oven, despite the fact that their installer left the tie wrap in.  That  same installer (upon returning to inspect) even had the gall to ask us how the tie wrap got in the back.  We said that it clearly had been left there.  He responded that the tie wraps are only located in the front of the oven upon delivery!!!   As if implying that we had put the tie wrap there. So our first new oven in 16 years, at a cost of $3,000 +, and permanently damaged upon installation due to installer error, and the retailer takes no responsiblity whatsoever !  No remorse, no attempt to remedy.   Not a very good feeling. Consumer Affairs and Attorney General complaints are being prepared.",2020-04-27T23:12:24.000Z

I had consistent problems ordering a…freezer,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I had consistent problems ordering a freezer from the box stores, and discovered one available on Plesser's online. I spoke with Jennifer, who was great. She processed an order for me and I waited for the delivery. And waited. And waited. Finally, I had to track down the shipment at the delivery company. No one at Plesser or the shipping company contacted me to indicate delivery was going to be delayed. Not the delivery company. Not Plesser. Through correspondences with the delivery company itself, I learned that the delivery delay was in NO WAY related to Covid. I live in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the company delayed delivery until it had other deliveries in this region. It revealed that to me. Kudos for candor, but that was never part of the original contract and agreement. If the company tells me April 10th my freezer is coming, and then in its correspondence it also tells me the chances are excellent the delivery will occur before the scheduled date, and then on the scheduled date the freezer does not arrive, and then I learn it won't be arriving until other deliveries in my area can be made -- well, that stinks.As far as Plesser is concerned, before the April 10th delivery date Jennifer called me back to tell me the original freezer I ordered was no longer available, but she could get me a replacement freezer in stock for the same delivery date. She fielded my concerned voice mails when I began to learn of the indifferent shipping company handling my freezer delivery. My rating of three stars is entirely due to the choice Plesser makes in its delivery company. I can't be the first person with this complaint. Unfortunately, three stars equals guilt by association. Plesser should retain a shipping company that equals its customer service. The job isn't done until I get what I paid for. I made plans to have the freezer on April 10th. I ordered it ten days earlier. Somewhere in between those dates I could have been told it wasn't going to arrive when I was told it would arrive. If Plesser was not aware of this, I think it should have been, or should stay in closer contact with the vendors that represent it. Or should work with vendors who stand by  their delivery contracts. Or work with vendors who contact it when it can't service Plesser's customers. Again, this had nothing to do with Covid.",2020-04-24T14:19:04.000Z

Admittedly, I was hesitant about ordering appliances online.  When the appliances arrived, the delivery guys unboxed every appliance for inspection.  Heck they even plugged in the TV to make sure it worked before leaving.  All in all...I have no regrets and probably saved several thousand dollars.  I would definitely use Plesser's Appliance again.",2020-04-24T11:22:12.000Z

I had to reschedule again, and on the day it was support to be delivered, they cancel again, saying they didn't have the drive to my route. Last reschedule, they said will arrived around 10am-1pm the following day with a text confirmation. I confirmed the time with them, and around 6pm that day, they some how had some time to drop the item off in 30 minutes. I just left from work and didn't know if I could make it in time. I had to asked my wife to wait for them, or miss the delivery. If they didn't arrived this time, I was willing to cancel the item. They did end up arriving 45 minutes later. Btw, the delivery guys throw the item around like it was a toy. The foam was all broken up. It was amazing the dishwasher didn't break along with the foam. Honestly, I will not buy from Plesser's appliance again because of the shipping company they use. The price saving amount wasn't worth the headache with AM Transportation. I will pay more next time with lowes/homedepot to avoid the headache, lesson learned.",2020-04-19T07:13:31.000Z

Excellent Customer Care and Service!!!!!!!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"First, let me say, I was a little skeptical at first to uses a distance store as far as New York to purchase an appliance after my stove crashed. The rush was on for Christmas, and I could not find a store locally to fit an unusual dimension. I searched the website and Plesser was one of the three that had what I needed. I had tried one of the other two stores but they couldn't produce the delivery time frame I needed. I then decided to use Plesser.  An attractive website advertisement and lucrative discount got my attention. My initial and ending contact was with Barry Dubin| Internet Sales Associate. I can't begin to express all the qualities this employee provided. His excellent customer care, pleasant, and kind phone voice, professionalism, knowledge of store stock, assessment of item prior to delivery, specific instruction about the delivery, cost of item and payment process, frequent update and follow-up with delivery and it's method gave me assurance and confidence that selecting this store was absolutely the best choice I've could have made with a distant purchase. Even with him having to go on vacation during the process, he made sure one of the other employees was given specific instructions to care for me until he returned. Upon his return, He picked up with the same attitude and excellent customer care. I can go on, and on with writing about Barry Dublin's excellent customer care. Plesser's Appliance is blessed to have such an employee as him.Thanks again for the excellent and outstanding customer care. I am thankful to have crossed your path. You will be greatly and highly recommended for your excellent service.Jean Sylvester Mobile, AL",2020-04-17T21:12:06.000Z

Plesser's to the rescue,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a specific model and size of a built in oven for a client here in Santa Fe. Had been dealing w/a local vendor and placed an order for said oven a month ago. I found out today that it would be yet another month before the item would be delivered. Blame it on Coronavirus. Long story short, I called Plesser's and got Jennifer on the phone.  She checked inventory and lo and behold, this very same sku that I'm looking for is in the warehouse. Order is now complete, and the appliance will be on a truck in a couple of days. I'll have it here in less than 2 weeks, a far cry better than delivery (maybe) in 5 weeks. Oh, did I mention that it was $175 cheaper than the other guys? Thank you Plesser's. Thank YOU, Jennifer!",2020-04-06T22:13:23.000Z

Tough to buy appliances online,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Due to recent events .  I Purchased a dryer online.   Never did that before.  Wouldn’t recommend it.   I choose Plessers as it’s a local business that I know would appreciate my business .   I could have gone to a big box store Which are still open.    The thing is .. You have to see what you buy for a big purchase.   I am not happy with it.  It was delivered Friday.  I ended up calling Sunday to be told there is nothing they could do.  Once installed it’s not refundable.  Try whirlpool and see if they could do something?    Very unsatisfied.   I’ve shopped at Plessers over the years and made big purchases.  Sub zero fridge.

"Plessers great, AM transport horrible",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I will say working with Presser's was fantastic.  Ordering was simple, sales associate was great and gave me the best deal that he could.  Absolutely amazing experience.  The issue and the reason for the 3 stars is due to the shipping company they use, AM transport.  Wish there was a separate way to review both like sales 5 star, shipping 1.  The shipping was set to 2 weeks after I ordered, which was fine.  I had the email, and took the day off that it was supposed to arrive.  The day before it was supposed to arrive I had not heard anything so I called them and they said that it wasn't going to be shipped that day but one of three days the following week.  I asked when they were going to tell me this because it would have been nice to know.  They replied that an email would be sent 24 hrs before.  I guess I am just supposed to be waiting in anticipation for this email.  I then asked if they can tell me a day in that range when it would be there so I could plan and they replied they could not.  So very convenient.  I told them it would have to wait two weeks since I was traveling for the military and they almost had the nerve to say there would have to charge me a holding fee but I guess out of the kindness of their hearts they did not.  Well needless to say my trip was canceled so I called and said I could accept shipment the next week.  They said OK and said they would put me down for delivery.  On one of the days it was supposed to be delivered I called to ask a status and they said that the person did not confirm shipment and it was not put on the schedule and I would have to wait another week.  Just keeps getting better folks.  So finally the next week I did receive confirmation it was going to be delivered.  Now I paid for the gold delivery service which means they would bring it into my house.  On the day of I get a call from the driver saying that due to new regs because of the COVID virus they could not come into my house.  I asked ""well how am I supposed to get it in then"".  He said he could help push it into my door but that is it.  Guess something is better than nothing.  Asked if it would fit in the door, it would just fit if I took off my doors, which I did.  When they tried to get it in, it would be too close and might damage the refrigerator so they stopped.  I said that the doors would have to come off and the manufacturer gives instructions on how to do this because it is a common thing.  They then told me they could not remove the doors, policy.  So how the  *%$^ am I supposed to get it in.  I paid for gold delivery and got rust delivery.  They at least got it up on my porch.  Needless to say I removed the doors myself and I got the fridge in my house by myself.  Thank goodness that I get a refund for the delivery because otherwise I would be requesting one.",2020-03-27T15:02:46.000Z

Great experience and nice price from a competitive company,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Great price, no tax , nice discount, polite and well informed phone service ( and easy phone order), all just as instructed and billed correctly. In general, also Quite responsive over email. Only small spot is they use a logistic 3rd party (AM logístics) to deliver from NY to Texas.  The appliance arrived to the city where I live 10 days before it was deliverered ( I tracked it) so I thought we would have it here sooner. Not the case!.  Overall while the fridge arrived on schedule, hand off was not flexible at all ( day or hour window) so it was an inconvenient Saturday night delivery 2 weeks since purchased ( promise was 7 bus days).In the end, I have an amazing appliance, came spotless, works great and I paid fairly so I am a happy customer. Will buy again if not rushed and I have already recommended Plessers to friends on the market for a similar fridge.Thanks guys.",2020-03-17T21:31:43.000Z

Words of Praise from Cali,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Being in California, I was hesitant to place an order for such a large appliance online...and from a company based in New York! Based on some other reviews, the longevity the business has been open, and the fact that they had the best ""Black Friday"" price for the refrigerator I wanted...I decided to give it a shot.  Turns out since the fridge new, it was on back order for a few months.  I received an email from the company notifying me of this and asking if I wanted to wait, or for them to offer some alternative suggestions. My kitchen was no where near completion at that time, so I opted to wait. Sometime near the beginning of the year, I was again notified by email the fridge was scheduled to ship 1/17.  On the 17th, I received tracking info and carrier information, and about a week later, received a delivery window confirmation.  The freight company also called me to confirm my availability at the time slot they'd scheduled me. The fridge arrived on time, was unboxed in my driveway, and brought inside completely unscathed (in PERFECT timing to be placed in the spot created for it). Start to finish, the communication I received was awesome, and everyone I actually had contact with was professional and seemed to have experience delivering items of this type.  I would absolutely order from Plesser's again, and suggest to anyone looking for appliances to check them out.  Thank you!!",2020-02-17T21:04:45.000Z

"Great Deal, Great Fridge, just Lacking Professionalism",Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"You offerred a great price with free shipping as almost every other place I looked at does, but I was still very disappointed.  This fridge came with the idea we were installing it.  That's fine, I don't like it but I get it takes some time.  The problem was, and I just had a Samsung delivered 4 years ago, was that there were NO dhandles on from the front of the fridge to inside the fridge on the drawers.  Are you kidding???  That was a very lame approach.  I don't want the reason because it doesn't matter.  I've had two refrigerators prior with no install and nobody has ever sent it with handles and drawer handles missing.  Looked unprofessional but more than that, I don't think I'll ever order from you folks again.  Makes me wonder what else I'll be dealing with the next tme I need something.  I'd rather have the handles and knobs at least put on.  Makes me think it was a little more inexpensive for that reason only and it wasn't by much, maybe $20 or $30, that I think I'll go to a different place and have it look pretty much done just install left.

We even made a change to our order the next day and she handled it very well.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the delivery time and information while in transit.  Email confirmation of our order was 3 weeks and 1 day before the arrival of the appliances and the only status information was ""In transit to distribution terminal"" from the time it left to the time it arrived.

install problems/good customer service,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Always order appliances from Plessers, good pricing, local, and friendly. Have not had problem with install until this last order. We ordered double oven based on reviews and the specs specifically indicated it would be a perfect fit into cabinet. Installers arrived in late afternoon, appeared rushed. Installed unit and was a one inch space open above cabinet. I asked if the unit came with mountable feet, he said No! There was also a leftover vent that he left unattached because of no space. I asked if he could wait and could cut some wood slats to elevate ovens, he did, but was still a half inch space and no room for vent. As soon as they rushed off, I look at installation instructions and it clearly said there were 4 attachable feet. There is also a video showing how to install from Kitchen Aid. I called Plessers's the next day to explain the problem. Although it was a Sat. Laury from customer service called me back immediatel. As we walked through the install directions on line and in video, she apologized and agreed. She ontacted the manafacturer and ordered the feet. Through no fault of hers, the order got mixed up and did not includescrews. The correct order got to us and Laury immediately set up a re- install. The crew arrived at exactly 9:00 A.M., installed the feet and vent quickly and efficiently and we are very happy. I was annoyed that after mentioning legs, the original installers did not take the 2 minutes required to look at the instructions. At one point Plessers said there was confusion because it was new model thathey had not installed before. Then read the instructions. I suspect the legs were thrown out when they removed the packing box..",2020-01-22T15:29:27.000Z

Ordering was great with Gene- sales…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Ordering was great with Gene- sales manager.Delivery logistics left something to be desired. Was to take delivery between 5-9pm. Received phone call to say they were running behind schedule and would not be able to deliver it until the next day between 7am and 11:00 am. No big deal, I had nowhere to be. At 8:50am the next day I receive a call saying they will be at my home in 20 minutes.  At 10:00am I call the dispatcher back to find out what is going on. After a few minutes I am told that the delivery system dropped me as the first delivery of the day. But the dispatcher had called me to tell me they were on the way. Doesn't seem to make sense to me. I was told they were 40 minutes away. The delivery guy called to tell me he was sorry and were on the way. The delivery team was very nice. I gave them each a tip even though they were unable to get the stove into the kitchen. I said, ""No problem we can take the door off.""  The head guy seemed surprised that the door could come off and when I tried to show him how it came off, it would not. It turns out that this new oven had little locking clips that needed to be moved on each hinge. I had removed the door from our old stove the night before by simply pulling the door up and out. The instructions to the new oven were inside the oven, but no one thought to look at them to see how to remove the door. The guy was very sure that they could remove the handle on the door. ""We do this all day every day"". When he started to remove the door handle, he said he was going to need to disassemble the entire door. I stopped him at that point. I called my husband at work and he said to just leave it in the dining room and he would get it into the kitchen. As soon as they left I promptly read the user's manual and figured out how to remove the door and bottom drawer. My husband easily got the new range into place in our kitchen. I was very happy with the sales process and would order again from Plesser's. The price was way lower than other retailers.",2020-01-10T23:33:19.000Z

But that is my error in calculation and I will have to make it work.  More is better right?   The men who delivered the refrigerator were kind and helpful but they did smell of marijuana smoke.  The refrigerator is still sitting in my kitchen area waiting for my handyman to install it so I cannot comment on the installation or operation at this point but the men who delivered it were very careful to make sure it got through my narrow doorways without a scratch.  I was happy with the delivery scheduling also all the way from New York and they worked with me since during the holidays I was out of town.

Lower price...better service! Win-Win.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"We needed a new fridge and had been keeping an eye on the price for over six months. Checked the big box stores and they had maybe 10% off the MSRP at best. Took a shot and checked out Plesser's and they had the fridge for a great price during their Columbus Day sale. I had to call to ask a question about the fridge and was helped right away and with no pressure to buy. I ended up placing the order online and then we scheduled a delivery date. We got a call that the fridge had come in but was damaged in transport. I was disappointed but happy they caught it before it got delivered to us. I doubt the big box stores would have caught that or cared enough to even fix the problem before it got to us. In the end, we got our fridge delivered with only a few extra days wait and the delivery guys were super nice and helpful. When looking for bigger appliances I always found myself checking out the big box stores just assuming the smaller guys would be more money but Plesser's really won me over from start to finish.

I wish I could give two reviews,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could give two reviews.  One for the sales process - a 5 star experience.Delivery through AM Trucking was horrendous - a total zero star experience.  They booked a date with a 4 hour window, I took off work to be here.  They called to confirm morning of.  Called again to say they'd be late.  Called at the end of the day to reschedule.  This happened 5 times.  There was an additional time I was not called at all.  I took 6 precious vacation days.  These guys couldn't get it right!  It was clearly a pattern.  Other than the one time they didn't call me, they followed it like a script.I called AM Trucking's number- the one that worked the week before to see if they'd be coming on the date they did not let me know there was a problem.  The number was disconnected!!  No explanation.  I had to call Plessers to run down the problem, which they did but were COMPLETELY powerless to solve the problem.Yes, Plessers is clearly pushed around by AM Trucking.  My appliance delivery was completely at the mercy of AM Trucking.When it finally did arrive, they dropped it hard exactly in the walkway in my front door!  He acted like dropping it like that was nothing and wanted my signature so he could leave.  When I suggested Plessers requires me to inspect the appliance upon delivery, the guy acted really put out and annoyed.  He started to unbox it right there.  I had to ask him to move it out of the doorway/walkway.  He got defensive and even more annoyed.  The experience with AM Trucking is reason enough to not order from Plessers again.  I will have to weigh the benefit of saving money against the total pain in the backside of delivery.  And by the way, the dollars lost from my vacation days will be part of the equation.If I could choose a different delivery option, I would definitely consider Plessers again.Once installation is complete, I'll know if they busted my appliance with that hard drop.",2020-01-02T23:25:17.000Z

Satisfied Overall,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a new LG range from Plessers in New York, because the price was significantly better than locally in Florida.  I was concerned about the shipping, and ultimately decided I should have paid the higher cost.  It took 3 weeks to arrive - much longer than anticipated, and unfortunately was damaged in shipment.  It would have been impractical to send it back, but Plessers did provide a substantial discount to compensate for the damage.  Overall, they were pleasant to work with, and very professional.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the New York area.  Shipping large appliances long distances is problematic, and I wouldn't likely do that again.",2019-12-20T16:06:02.000Z

Good value but salesman are rude,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"This has been my experience .I went first time to get the lay of the land and understand their inventory and pricing.I purchased stove, dishwasher and microwave ( all high end ) Here is the good part.They will beat the price of large chain store.Here what I did not like .My salesman had some medical issue / doctor appointment so I accommodated him so I ended up showing up several times to the store as we missed each other. (Once you deal with one person you are kind of tied up with that person) They saw this as a sign of weakness/ desperation and did not budge on the price when I swap one appliance to another.Instead of appreciating that I accommodated his need he actually told me to buy somewhere else. This I thought was rude and I felt good deed was punished . Overall the store is a good value but salesman are not your friend .",2019-12-19T23:53:02.000Z

The difference between 1 star and 5?  Customer service.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I spent half an hour with the Big Chill salesperson at Plesser's to make sure that my custom refrigerator order was correct.  One of the main points was that the refrigerator handle had to be on the right-hand side.  A month later, the delivery folks wheeled my brand new fridge down the driveway... and - the handle was on the left side.       Who delivers a custom order without actually LOOKING at it to make sure it's correct before loading it on the truck?  Answer: Plesser's.     I was *so* disappointed.  I had taken a day off work to wait for this delivery, and moved all the furniture around in my house so that they could get the old fridge out and the new one in without any trouble.       The delivery guy called the Plesser's manager on his cell phone right in front of me, so I know they knew about it.  I expected my cell phone to ring at any moment.    No one from Plesser's EVER called me.  Not once.  I called them, and they said ""The order we sent in was correct.  This is the manufacturer's fault.  YOU have to call them and see what they're willing to do for you.""      As a dealership, they were sure willing to take the big $$$ from us for this refrigerator, but when it came to offering a little customer service - nada.  I expected at least that they might a) actually call me and b) say, ""We're so sorry that your order got messed up, we'll call the manufacturer right away and get your replacement order expedited.""  Nope.     I could have ordered this refrigerator directly from the manufacturer myself.  The reason I went to a dealership was so that someone ""professional"" was taking care of the transaction.  So that if something went wrong, they would make it right.  No such luck.     As for the Big Chill company (the manufacturer), they were wonderful.  The Big Chill representatives apologized profusely, called me back several times and exchanged emails with me to make sure the new delivery date was correct, and they also offered me a matching appliance to soften the blow of not getting my dreamed-of and long-saved-for Big Chill fridge on time.  Those folks at Big Chill know something about customer service.     Plessers?  Not so much.",2019-12-12T21:20:05.000Z

In my research for the perfect refrigerator, I found the door in door 27 ft.³ LG. The price of the refrigerator was way over my budget; however, Plessers price could not be beat and I was able to afford and replace my 25-year-old refrigerator with the LG. Shipping was free, not quite sure how that’s possible but so appreciated, and the delivery company that they partnered with was especially professional and courteous when delivering the fridge. Plessers communication was quite thorough as well! Thank you for making this happen and I am in love with my new fridge, I shouldn’t be but I am.",2019-12-04T16:12:41.000Z
Plesser's ruined Thanksgiving and failed to lift a finger.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Ordering an item from Plesser's and actually getting the item are two entirely different experiences.  Your phone staff does a reasonably good job.  They know the merchandise and are able to answer questions etc. - this was fine.  I ordered a Bosch dishwasher....but wasn't told on the phone that it wasn't in stock and would take two weeks to get it into the warehouse.  I called back and was upsold to a more expensive Bosch that was in stock.  That was a Friday and the dishwashwer shipped out the following Tuesday.  That's where the good news ends.  Plesser's entrusting deliveries to AM Trucking is a colossal mistake! They attempted delivery with 20 mins notice - no one was home and the delivery had to be rescheduled.  It was another 6 days before the 2nd appointment because the ""HUB"" is in another state.  The 2nd delivery attempt was also unsuccessful because despite driving in from the other state on the specified date, my dishwasher never made it onto the truck that morning.  That was the Mon before Thanksgiving. Most ethical, responsible companies, having failed twice, would have made extraordinary efforts to get us our dishwasher before the holiday.  AM?  Not so much.  We were told the ""next time they would be in our delivery area"" was Saturday.  We did get our dishwasher on Saturday - 22 days after it was ordered.  We had relatives visiting from 4 countries and this literally ruined everything.  They key fact here is that neither Plesser's nor AM Trucking made any effort to make this right.  AM offered us a $100 gift card for our trouble, but showed up Sat without it.  Nice.  This is a fly by night, seat of the pants operation and Plesser's has absolutely no intention of getting your purchase to you in the timeframe specified.  Buyer beware.",2019-12-04T14:23:48.000Z
Lured by a really great price and…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Lured by a really great price and promises of trouble free delivery, we purchased an inductive range. The delivery turned out to be nightmarish. Plessers said their truck would take our range to a ""local"" delivery service and that they would deliver it to my designated address. Well, the ""local"" delivery business (AM Trucking) is in Charlotte, NC over 200 miles from us! After two failed scheduled delivery dates and 3 weeks, when it finally got here the range was so badly damaged by rough handling we had to refuse delivery. To Plessers' credit, they refunded all of our money in a timely and hassle free manner. To their discredit, their claims concerning delivery were very misleading and their ability to affect a solution was non-existent.",2019-12-04T14:18:24.000Z

A bit ridiculous I think even though eventually it will be refunded. Delivery should be free as is with others. I’ve never experienced this before.  Then additional payment required to have old appliance brought up to put on curb is a first for me.  Also you wanted me to pay even more  to take it away! That should be a given.

BE CAREFUL,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I wasn’t comfortable ordering a $2000 under the counter icemaker from the internet, but I spent a lot of time reading all the great reviews. I also spoke to Jennifer Obrein who was very sweet and she assured me I would be %100% satisfied. She sent me the information on the appliance and I called her prior to order and asked if it came with drain pump. She placed me on hold and confirmed it did, so I placed the order. The delivery went perfect except when I went to install - there was not a pump. I called immediately and Jennifer said “did you not receive the correct Ice maker?”  I explained there wasn’t a drain pump. She said she would call me back and said I could return but there would be a 25% re-stocking fee and a $175 delivery fee. I ask to speak to her manager and he said there was nothing he could do about it. He stated that they recorded all phone calls, but when I asked him to go review the tapes he did not respond. Then he told me to hire a plumber to install an after market pump. I declined. I ended up having to spend another $500 and they sent me the correct one. JUST FYI - THIS IS THE 1st TIME I’VE EVER COMPLETED AN ON LINE REVIEW FOR ANYTHING I’VE PURCHASED. It takes a lot for me to complain, but this was a horrible experience.",2019-11-28T16:39:05.000Z

disappointed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The products are very good. It was the personal experience that I was very unhappy with. I ordered a new refrigerator, a washer and dryer with the bells and whistles. I measured the space to make sure they would fit and all was good.The day they delivered the appliances, they did a great job with the washer and dryer.When I came to the refrigerator. It was too big to take it up the stairwell.I understood this and asked for the same refrigerator but a much smaller cubic foot storage. The delivery people said it should only cost $100 extra.A Plesser’s representative informed me that I would have to pay a restocking fee of 30% plus a $300 shipping fee. (even though on their website, shipping is $50) After arguing the point, they dropped the restocking fee because I still wanted the smaller refrigerator. But they would not honor the sale price I bought the original refrigerator. After playing phone tag for a month. I got no where.I had to pay another $900.For the inconvenience and the stress. I would not recommend buying online outside of my state. I was going save $1,400 by buying online.I still saved $500 but for my stress and sanity. The experience was not worth the savings.",2019-11-15T00:06:15.000Z

Best appliance purchase I’ve ever had.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I found Plessers online after putting in the model number and they had the best price.  When I got to the website I thought if they ship from New York it would cost me a fortune, well I was wrong.  I got the refrigerator shipped from New York to CA and it cost me $49, locally it was going to cost over $100.   I was also offered the 5 year warranty extended to 10, the price was great.   Anyway, the person I spoke with on the phone was super nice, very helpful, her name was Jennifer O’Brien.  All paperwork was sent by email.  They kept me informed of the trucking company, when they would arrive, etc.  They  arrived right on time.  The only problem I encountered was when my husband plugged it in, the noise was horrible so he unplugged it.  I called Plessers and they had me call the Manufacturer and they came out the next morning.  Something came loose during transit so it was fixed really quickly.  It now runs beautiful and extremely quiet.  I was very very happy with the service and my product.  My next appliance purchase will be Plessers for sure.",2019-11-14T05:19:30.000Z

"decent enough service from Plesser's, horrendous service from delivery company",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Most of my problems with my purchase were due to the delivery company Plesser's had contracted with to ship my item. Plesser's chose to ship my item with AM trucking. my experience with this shipping company was atrocious and i cannot fathom how Plesser's continues to work with them. I placed my order and coordinated with Plesser's to have my item's delivery coincide with my moving into my new apartment. AM trucking didn't contact me until 3 days after the date I was expecting to receive my delivery. the automated recording i recieved gave me the option to confirm or reschedule my delivery time, when i tried to reschedule i was told they would contact ""shortly"". after several hours waiting i tried calling their office to reschedule, after multiple attempts i was finally able to talk with a representative from AM trucking and was informed that they could only deliver to my area on fridays despite my being told by Plessers that my item could be delivered for the monday after my move. AM proposed a new delivery time 2 weeks after their initial attempt which i agreed to and asked for confirmation of the delivery window so i could put in a leave request with my office to be present for the delivery.over the next 2 weeks all my attempts to get confirmation of the delivery time were met with either silence or ""we'll get back to you"" the only way i was able to get any sort of concrete response from AM was when out of frustration i contacted Plesser's to have them intervene on my behalf 2 days before AM's proposed delivery day.I have never dealt with a delivery company that was so unresponsive or disorganized as to be incapable of scheduling their truck routes more than one day in advance as they claim.If i had known that Plesser's contracted with AM i never would have placed my order through Plesser's and instead spent the extra money to make my purchase as another store.",2019-11-04T17:36:43.000Z
Delivery nightmare,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Delivery nightmarePlesser's might be a good choice for orders but they use AM Home Delivery service - it is nightmare.Delivery company AM Home Delivery (order #2415317), arranged delivery on Thursday, October 17. After checking staircase, I was told that this particular refrigerator can’t be brought to 2nd floor apartment because stairs are too tight. I’ve seen my old refrigerator of the same width, height and depth brought to 2nd floor apartment without problem 10 years ago by Sears. I did call LG to make sure that this particular model would get through 29” door frame (the narrowest point in pathway) and was assured that it’s OK. On October 17 AM Home Delivery guys promised me that management call me the same day to arrange another delivery team. Never happened. I call on October 19 myself, spoke to Castro ((718) 272-5900)  and was told that delivery would be done on October 21 by another more experienced team, This more experienced team  did not show up on October 21.On 10/22/19  I call  Eugene Coughlin at Plessers  and canceled the order  and was nicely assured about refund minus small fee which he’ll find out shortly and call me back. Eugene Coughlin never call back or return my multiple calls. Instead, I got a call from Plessers customer service and was told about $580 fees for restocking, transportation and open box (the box was not open at all) which would be deducted from my payment of $1644.That’s outrageously unfair. Two times I’ve moved old refrigerator to make space for new one, disconnected/connected water line, took time from work (lost money) and have to pay for AM Home Delivery lack of qualification.Last week I have new refrigerator delivered into 2nd floor of my house within 1 hour 20 minutes.($65 delivery, versus $125 AM Home Delivery) Two days later old refrigerator was removed in 1 hour by NE applience.recicling program (free).  Both without 90 degree turn on stairs and without “experienced team”.I don’t feel that I have to be charged at all for AM Home Delivery incompetence, but just opposite - it would be fair to compensate my time and disappointments. Don’t expect it from AM Home Delivery though.To resume: would rate this minus ****, if this option was available.",2019-11-04T17:35:55.000Z

Allow twice as much time for delivery,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Overall a positive experience. I purchased with the expectation of 2 - 3 week delivery as advertised. The refrigerator didn't ship from Plesser's until 4 weeks from purchase. We received it a little over 6 weeks from purchase. I did contact Plesser's once and they were courteous and I could even understand them but they weren't very helpful. I got into a he said/ she said situation between Plesser's and AM Transportation, the trucking company. Plesser's said they shipped it and AM Transportation said they hadn't received it and no one seemed to know where it was or when it would arrive. There was no coordination on the delivery. Your shipment is scheduled to arrive on such and such a date between the hours of such and such. Didn't seem to matter if that coincided with our schedule. The shipment came on a straight truck so they were able to deliver it where we wanted. They had a lift gate so we didn't need extra equipment. Overall a positive experience though.",2019-10-31T13:00:45.000Z

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it took so long to get to me! I ordered the range on September 13th and didn't even get a ship notification until September 19th....then it took another 10 days to make it to me.

Everything is great except for the dent door on the range,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"My lg range arrived with a dented door. Shipper unwrapped most of the packaging but left some of the packaging that hid the dent. So, did not discover until later after they left. It has been 3 weeks since it was delivered but the damage has not been fixed. 3 weeks seems like a long time to resolve. Another issue is I have only received one follow up call but do not know what is going on or etc.There was a appliance tech visit a few weeks previous the Saturday after the Tuesday delivery, which I thought was really fast. I also thought the delivery from NY was really fast and on the low end of the estimated windows. Check it it and pricing was fast and the best in the market at the time. Great deals. Everyone has been friendly too.I would add a star if the range gets fixed soon, but we will see...********Update: 10/14/2019The repairs were made to the dented oven door frame within a reasonable amount of time. It took a week for repair company to receive the replacement part and was able to make the repair on a Saturday!

I found this LG at the same box store and was excited but the price bump spooked me. I went back to Plessers and saw it for hundreds less — including delivery. The email communications were great and a rep followed up with a no pressure offer on an extended warranty that I added — and was still saving over the box store.

I saved about $600 on my purchase.Delivery time was more than 3 weeks, this was not a good experience since the sales person told me it would ship the following Monday from the weekend ordered.The actual delivery was a joke to say the least... for an additional $50 that I paid extra for, they did the following:1. Unloaded the frig from the truck.2. Put it on a dolly and carted the frig to the front of my door.3. Lifted the huge box off the frig to check for damage.4. Carted the frig in front of the space it was going into.It would be much to say that it took them 15mins to do the above, ... They left all the plastic and Styrofoam on the frig, they could careless if it even worked, no install of any kind! Truly a joke of a delivery. When I asked, if they were going to check if it worked, they said that would be $75 more...TO MAKE MATTERS EVEN WORST, THEY LEFT THAT HUGE BOX AT THE FRONT OF MY DOOR... I had to cut it down to put it in my dumpster!!! It took us 2 hours to take all the plastic and Styrofoam off and level the frig. They left with a smirk on their face...

Plessers delivered our GE refrigerator on Saturday and removed the old one and scratched our front door. Upon opening the refrigerator doors we found the inside shelf was damaged. The delivery man made a call to arrange for another to be delivered. It was supposed to be delivered as soon as possible. Your company has no deliveries on Monday and Tuesday. When we called to check on date we were told the item wasn’t shipped from warehouse yet. So delivery was even later. The whole experience was extremely disappointing and totally frustrating. I lost some of my food because of delay as well as my time. The refrigerator door was not installed properly and have to call service to fix it.

Purchasing a large appliance out of state.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I have always purchased large appliances in person at a local Sears store in the past until their stores started closing. Those purchases lasted a long time with no problems! However recently I purchased a refrigerator at a BestBuy store because of the sale price and particular model availability.  I was very upset with their incompetence and poor customer service when upon delivery there was a major problem. I will not promote them or ever buy a large item from them again. So with that in mind I did a search online for the best price for a new stove regarding a particular model.  I read the great ratings and history of plessers.com and decided to order out of state after talking to salesperson Steve Stica. I was very impressed with his willingness to answer alot of questions and help for ordering the stove. He was very knowledgeable and pleasant. The stove is on the way as I write this review and if there is any issue I will update this review. But currently I expect the same great results and product when the stove is here.

Poor delivery management/customer not a priority,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Parts of my order were misrouted to another state(!) and 4weeks after ordering we have still not received the appliance we paid for.Plessers is using AM Home Delivery & Trucking Inc for shipping but neither of them are taking ownership of the delivery problem.Mistakes can happen but it has been a poor experience for us to call daily on the status of the shipment instead of Plessers or AM to keep communications and we do not feel that either of them is making it a priority to get the appliance we ordered and paid for.How hard can it be nowadays to get a package from one state to another in a few days??After multiple complaints Plessers did agree to a discount but we would have rather seen them spend the money on handing over the package to UPS/FEDEX to get it to us on time - we are now 14days past the promised delivery and still waiting.,2019-09-26T16:45:26.000Z

Don't buy from them,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy from them. You do save some but pain to go over communication to get status on delivery is too much and later what they promise on compensation, they never do that. I was suppose to get delivery in 5-7 business days but later they split the order without any confirmation/knowledge and didnt had clue on when will dryer be delivered. First part of order with fridge and washer was delivered after 7 days of promised date but no dryer and dryer was delivered after 8 days. They will drop the ball saying they dont have control on delivery and will ask customer to talk to delivery company. I ended up spending money for renting due to their delays. Service is till they get your order and money and later as if they are doing any favor by talking to you. Their delivery company drivers are rude.

The price of this refrigerator from other sites is no less than $3500.Initially I was skeptical buying from Plessers because the advertising price was 30% lower than other stores or sites.  I googled and did some research just to make sure Plessers was legit. I am glad I ended up taking the risk to buy. THIS IS BY FAR MY GREATEST PURCHASE EVER. I am enjoying my brand new refrigerator.

This is our 2nd purchase from them and we will most likely be ordering a new range from them very soon. Be advised in advance that depending on where you live, it will take 2 weeks to get your order.

After placing an order with AJ Madison which completely went unfulfilled after several weeks, because their finance department never ran the AJ Madison branded credit card, we reached out to Plesser's to place the order. Dealing with the sales representative was simple. The only hiccup was Samsung was out of one of the appliance models, we had to take separate delivery of the appliances and wait on the microwave to arrive several weeks after everything else (but it wasn't Plesser's fault!).

Although some items were on back-order, Plesser's promptly filled my order and shipped it in just over three-week’s time.Kudos to Stephen who assisted me with my order; the individual in shipping that provided me the tracking information; and Laury who processed replacement of my damaged microwave in just one business day.  I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.However; I can’t say much for their delivery service for non-local orders (AM Home Delivery), who took two weeks to get my items delivered after they were picked up.

Unfortunately, I did not discover my error until the unit was delivered and uncrated. This was not a case of me changing my mind after-the-fact or finding a better price elsewhere. It was an honest mistake. I immediately contacted Plesser's, requesting to exchange the unit for the one I'd meant to buy. Of course I expected to pay something for the return. They shouldn't have to lose money on my error; I should. But to what extent? Plesser's response was to not only punish me for my mistake, but score a hefty profit on it as well. Their terms: a $170 return shipping fee + $350.70 (a 30% ""restocking"" fee)--meaning I'd take a $520.70 hit on a (brand-new, perfect-condition) $1169 return. How disappointing that Plesser's would seek to capitalize on my good-faith error with a such an unkind, greedy, bad-faith response.",2019-09-13T03:25:44.000Z

So, they had to leave everything in my garage for another week until I called them if they were coming back to do the installation which I have already paid. Again, they told me to wait for someone to call me.This time the truck driver came and tried to do the installation. They did wrong installation o the dryer power chord.

They confirmed a delivery time and date and didn't even show up. It turns out that they didn't even load my item into the truck that morning and did not even let me know. I wasted an entire day waiting for them. I called them throughout the day to check where my order was and they just kept telling me that the driver would call me 30 minutes prior to delivery. When it finally passed the delivery time they let me know that it didn't even leave the warehouse. They scheduled a delivery for the next day. I asked to please be an early drop off so I don't waste another day. They wait until the last minute of the delivet window to drop it off. When they dropped it off they left a mess. They didn't take away the box or even plug in the refrigerator. I even paid extra for them during the check out process to get the clean up service.

Bought a kitchen aid refrigerator,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought a kitchen aid refrigerator. Arrived with bad finish.  Plessers  did replace,  but second arrived with the same finish problem, And one of the vegetable drawers of refrigerator compartment does not pull out smoothly, and front of drawer pulls off  the drawer when you try to pull it out.  Kitchen Aid is sending out a technician to check the drawer issue. Still waiting on that.  New replacement refrigerator doors will take 8 weeks to get to the service company.  Assuming there are no further problems, this will have taken apx  5 months from order date (5/2019 to 10/2019 to get this problem resolved by Plessers and Kitchen Aid.  In the future I will only buy my appliances from a major appliance brick & mortar store.  Beware of signing receipt of purchase from Plessers trucking company.  It states you accept the unit as it is when in fact with a large appliance one cannot fully check it out to make sure the unit is functional and 100% Ok.  It took me a good half hour to just get the wrappings off.  Pressers did offer me a 100% warranty coverage for 5 years and small financial incentive for my inconvenience, but refused to refund my money. I’ll probably need the full warranty in the future with this unit.",2019-08-28T20:22:58.000Z

I wish I had found Plessers sooner!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had found Plessers sooner! We went appliance shopping locally, and they had a price match guarantee. This was the one and only time I purchased ANYTHING without days of research first... and this is why.In my attempt to make sure I hadn't overpaid for our appliances locally, I found Plessers online. I went back to the store where we purchased our washer, dryer, and fridge for them to price match what I had found at Plessers - and the caveat is they only price match other LOCAL stores. (That part must have slipped their mind when telling us.)Well, we still needed three more appliances. Plessers, here we come! After looking online, my husband and I decided to call Plessers, and I'm glad we did. Barry helped us, and put together a package that came in even less than online. Not only were the prices better than anywhere else, the delivery to Colorado will be free once I fill out the rebate, and the warranty purchased was better and less expensive than competitors. We purchased a microwave, dishwasher, and range through Barry at Plessers. We received them in (3) weeks - which was fine with us since we're remodeling - and in perfect condition. Had I gone with Plessers for my entire purchase, instead of getting sucked in locally, I would have saved  $1,200! Barry emailed all of my warranty information. The Plessers website also has every manual readily available online for easy download (for those of us who prefer to keep electronic documents instead of books that come with the appliances). Getting the forms for the delivery rebate was easy too.Oh! And Plessers is an authorized dealer for the Kitchenaid appliances we bought, so we received a rebate from Kitchenaid as well.Barry was great! Plessers was great!

SAMSUNG NX589421SS,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the gas range from Plesser's Appliances. The price was lowest I could find and additions they also offered white glove delivery inside the house which also included unpacking the appliance. Upon unpacking I noticed a few scratches and dents on the side and contacted Plesser's customer care team. They were excellent and offered me three options, either I could refuse delivery and get full refund, or refuse delivery and get a new replacement or third that I accept the delivery and get a discount. I opted for the third option. I am very pleased the way my situation was handled and would strongly recommend them to my friends. I will definitely buy other appliances from them if/when I need. Kudos to their sales rep and customer care team.",2019-08-20T13:54:26.000Z

Luckily we still had it and the delivery guy Bobby said that he NEVER TAKES BOXES BACK- WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD TO HAVE THE BOX. SECOND RANGE ALSO CAME IN DAMAGED. The refrigerator arrived damaged as well. That's three out of five products that were delivered. The first set of appliances came to us in a uhaul truck...

What a thoroughly positive experience!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"What a thoroughly positive experience! In late June, we had determined what appliances we really wanted for our major kitchen remodel through research and looking at a local appliance store. However, the total locally was above what we had budgeted for the appliances. Before settling for lesser models, I decided to search the internet and I found Plessers.com running their July 4 sale. Not only did it bring the cost in line with our budget, but it included extended warranties we couldn't get locally.Stephen, our Plesser's salesperson, was incredibly helpful, assisting us in determining that the appliances we selected would work for us and ensuring we had all the information we needed about discounts and rebates. He subsequently helped us select an alternate range with similar features when we learned our electric service was insufficient to support our original choice. He also arranged for delivery to occur when we needed it to within our contractor's project schedule. Then, when the transport company fouled up the delivery schedule we had arranged, Plesser's Order Status department acted as a liaison with the trucking company to try to get the delivery as close to back on schedule as possible and arranged upgraded delivery service because of the issue. Lastly, Nyra in the Plesser's customer service department very efficiently handled a damage claim for one appliance that arrived with slight cosmetic dents.The appliances look fantastic in our new kitchen and they're exactly what we wanted, which we couldn't have achieved buying locally. It's very apparent why Plesser's is still going strong after 100 years in business! Highly recommended!",2019-08-16T18:26:55.000Z

We used this savings to buy the extended warranty given the short life span of our last fridge.We initially had a problem with the delivery in that they were not going to take away the old unit, and when I asked about it, they told me that I would have to reschedule because this was an ""upgrade"". I called their customer support number and left a message about how disappointed I was that this ended up happening after I specifically asked about this service when I ordered the fridge, but honestly didn't expect anyone to do anything about it.They called the next day after getting it straightened out with the shipping company to let me know that they had dealt with the issue and they would in fact take away the old fridge.Thanks for your great prices and great customer service.  The ordering was easy, the fridge came exactly when they said it would, and we're very happy with it.",2019-08-16T03:44:16.000Z

Throughout the ordering process and delivery Jennifer kept me informed, and was very responsive to calls or emails all the time.Even with all the work they put in, their prices are unbeatable. No idea how they do it. No one comes close, and I did my research. The appliances were delivered on time, everything was as promised, nothing less.Now, real customer orientation is usually showing when there's a problem - and as it happens, I had some minor scratches on two of the three products I bought. I sent an email with pictures, and the next day was offered a goodwill gesture which was perfectly acceptable. So even after selling the units for a great price they did not hesitate to put things right when there was a problem.I would use Plesser's again without a doubt.

Plesser's never said they were sorry. it took almost a week to order a new unit. It also took 3 weks to deliver. and when i got it the box was ripped pen in 2 places. the delivery guys cut the box open and we inspected the unit. it was complete and undamaged. Viking is the same price everywhere. I was hoping for good service from Plesser's.

Viking appliances - Worth the wait!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I had work done in my home recently and was specific about the appliances I wanted to install.  I walked into Plesser's in July of 2018, and while everyone said hello, Mark Zupo was the only one to ask me if I needed help. He showed me different kitchen options and explained the differences, but I knew what I wanted.  He said he was able to obtain the appliances for me, but did not have them at the showroom (they were also under construction.)  Since I had already seen them, I just needed to order, but was not ready for delivery since my work was not going to start until later in the year. He was great to work with during my renovation and stayed on top of my request, without being pushy. After placing the order, he held the appliances for several months until they were ready to be installed.  He matched my pricing and looked for discounts I could get from the vendor.  He also helped me pick out a refrigerator drawer that was a better fit for my budget and works perfectly.  I was recommended to Plesser's from a contractor I did not use, but had I not stopped by the store that day, I probably would have gone with someone more local to me. .  As far as the appliance go, they look great in my kitchen, and so far, I am very happy with all the choices.  The dishwasher is so quiet, I often forget it is on.  The refrigerator is a side-by-side that is a little louder, but mostly because of the ice maker.  I have only used the stove, but love the fact it has six burners and you can control the flame height.  If you are looking for appliances, I would recommend taking the ride to Babylon to visit this location and ask for Mark when you go in. You will not be disappointed",2019-07-21T12:49:31.000Z

Samsung  NX58M9420SS,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The buying process was very easy.  Delivery was excellent.  Tracking the order could be improved but was adequate.   The Samsung range is great.   Powerful burners and great modulation of temperature.  I tested the oven temperature with a calibrated remote probe thermometer.  The oven was extremely accurate thru all temperature ranges.  This was the first oven that wasn’t off by 25 degrees at 450F!  I am definitely happy with my purchase from Plesser’s Appliance,2019-07-17T23:06:59.000Z

"Pleasers was mostly great, BUT",Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Pleasers was mostly great. However I wish there could’ve been some way to know that my downdraft oven would actually vent out the back. I had my own person install it, the unexpected ventilation required cutting a hole in the back of my bar. That’s because a floor joist was located in the only possible place for ventilation ductwork. Also the bottom drawer on my model is faux! So now we have nowhere to put our casserole dishes! 🙄Too bad more downdrafts are no longer available!! Because the only other alternative had terrible reviews! It was nice that Plesser’s website offered these reviews, but maybe talking to an actual person would have been better!",2019-07-17T22:28:44.000Z

We still have not received our…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,We still have not received our appliance.  According to Plesser's it was shipped on June 14.  I called twice after shipment confirmation wondering why it was taking so long to deliver.  They said it was in Houston being scheduled for delivery.  On my second call it took someone to intervene and get me an approximate ship date.  The delivery company could deliver before July 4th and then wanted to deliver on Friday July 5th (obviously not the best day on the calendar to deliver anything)!  It is now July 10th at 5:52pm and we have still heard nothing.  Whoever Plesser's is contracting the delivery end of their fulfillment process is a joke.  Unless compensated in some fashion we will never order from Plesser's again and they will likely read a few more social media accounts of our experience.  Find a way of making this right!!!!!!!,2019-07-10T22:54:52.000Z

They had no idea how to disassemble the fridge doors and actually moved the fridge into the house with one door dangling from the water hose that feeds the water bar. obviously the move resulted in several scratches and dents. After the fridge was placed in the kitchen they reassembled the doors and sure enough one door is extremely more elevated than the other.in other words - pricing is competitive! plessers costumer services is good! plessers tracking system is nice but the minute it moves to the local transportation team everything was amateuristic and unprofessional.for bigger items that require special transportation I would advise Plessers to get more involved in the choice of their moving companies and make sure they come well equipped and well trained in case disassembly or maneuverability issues arise during the move.",2019-07-10T16:33:35.000Z

I’m pleased with my refrigerator but it…,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I’m pleased with my refrigerator but it took about 10 days longer to get it than we planned. The shipping company that was used here in Dallas, Texas was impossible to deal with. The female we talked with was unhelpful, rude, condescending, disrespectful and uncaring about our situation. She did not care that it was in Dallas sitting and waiting to be delivered as we had planned 9-10 days before. We had to wait until she said it was going to be delivered. We paid for a Gold Plan delivery that would put the refrigerator in the kitchen. I was told I could attach it to the wall. She said I would have to pay an extra  $100. dollars to have the the box removed, more to connect to water line, buy a water line if I didn’t have one. So it was over $200.00. This is a racket!!!  I said NO just deliver .   I called the day of delivery and she said it was scheduled between 9-1 and  I would be their last delivery.  So I was thinking of going ti the store, until I saw a truck. They were at my neighbors. Then they called and asked if I was at home and they had a delivery for my neighbors house. The girl running the delivery office had on purpose told me it was going to be around 1:00 pm until I received my delivery hoping I would leave and miss my delivery and have to reschedule. She told the delivery guys the wrong address my next door neighbors so I would not get my delivery.  I told the delivery guys the story and they were suppose to report her.  But he said I understand that you asked about us setting up and taking the box. I told him I did but this same girl told me you could not do it because you didn’t have any tools. He said he has tools and stated he could do the water line placement for 25.00 but would have to charge me &100.00 to take the box. I did it but I truly think all of these people are in on it. Its a scam and I got played. I feel stupid because I gave them each a tip for their help. The main guy had me write the check out to him and took both of the tips. He said he would split the check and the cash with the other guy. I doubt it!Lesson learned!!! Buy in town.",2019-07-09T23:50:11.000Z

I needed the appliances as soon as possible to put my condo on the market.  Over two weeks later I called Plesser's when I didn't hear from the delivery company and was told at that time that one of the four appliances I ordered was on back order and so they've delayed shipment of all the appliances.  No one contacted me to let me know or informed me of my options.  The customer service rep I spoke to, Patrick, was very helpful and after I explained my situation to him, he made arrangements to get the appliances delivered in two batches so that photos of the condo could be taken for the listing.  They were, however, able to ship all the appliances at the same time, but then it took an additional two weeks before the appliances arrived at the warehouse and several more days before it got delivered.

No one told me that it would take about 4 weeks to deliver the items.I was told the washer would come without water hoses and I would have to buy my own.  I did.  The washer came with hoses so I wasted $30 on my own.I was told the dryer would ship without a power cord so I would have to buy my own 3-wire, 30-amp cord.  I did.  The dryer came with an installed 4-wire 30-amp cord.  Could not use it with my 3-wire 30-amp outlet.  Switching to the 3-wire cord was supposed to be easy according to the video....but the power panel in the video did not match the power panel on the dryer.  There was no factory ground wire.  Lost another couple of days trying to verify the proper wiring process.The $40 stacking kit is just plastic.  The tops of these expensive machines are wood (at least I got saw dust as I drilled to attach the plastic stacking kit.  My concern is that I have a powerful washer spinning a heavy basket with a dryer perched on top.  The only thing keeping the washer from throwing the dryer through a window is a set of four short woodscrews drilled into chip board.",2019-07-03T19:00:23.000Z

However once my items were received in their location they took another 6 days to deliver at 9 PM, limiting my ability to verify that delivery was complete without incident.

I phoned and was immediately put in touch with Frances in Customer Service and she handled the replacements and repairs with no hassle, no questions, no issues regarding the damages.Without Frances taking care of the problems for me, this would have been a long and arduous process I am sure.

Plesser's Review - California Delivery,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I came across Plesser's while looking for the lowest price for a refrigerator, dishwasher, and range. After doing a lot of research I decided to take the leap of faith to move forward with the order for a number of reasons:1. No tax - here in CA, it's almost 10%2. Cheapest price - Going with them saved me almost $10003. Customer service via email was very responsive and helpful (they're actual U.S. based people)I placed the order even though the Yelp reviews were either really great or really bad. From the time the order was placed it took 3 weeks for the appliances to come. 3 weeks seemed reasonable, given that they're shipped from NY. Also, the particular refrigerator I purchased was all sold out in local stores. The delivery company was on time and swift. My appliances were delivered without a scratch and in brand new condition.The only thing I am waiting on are the rebates. Hopefully those go through as well.",2019-06-27T21:27:46.000Z

Shipping Company they use is Terrible - 49 day delivery,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have no problem with Plessers itself.  The issue is the company THEY choose to use for shipping.  I purchased an undercounter ice machine from Plessers specifically because they said it was in stock and my old one had failed.  All other companies had to order it from KitchenAid which would add 2 weeks to the delivery time.  Once it shipped it was supposed to be here in 5 days according to their map.  It took 49 days to get here!  The shipping company is a total joke but probably cheap for Plessers.The shipper contacted me the first time to say it would be delivered on a certain day between 3:00Pm and 7PM.  We waited and nothing showed up so I called the shipping company.  I got the after hours cust service line and held for 40 minutes until I was first in line.  Then I got disconnected.  I called back in and it happened again.  The next time they confirmed a delivery time (a week later after EXPEDITING my order).  I called during the day to make sure it was being delivered.  Guess what - It's not on the truck!  So a week later when they promised delivery I called the day before.  Guess what, it's not even at the terminal!!!  So almost 2 months later I received it.Love the ice machine but I will NEVER use Plessers again because of the shipping company they use.  I did communicate this to Plessers and got no response so they don't give a rat's a**.",2019-06-27T15:24:42.000Z

Lousy installers and customer support,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We ordered a $600 Bosch microwave oven on May 7, 2019 and had it installed by Plesser's. The installaters told us it was working, and left quickly. Almost immediately we found the turntable was not spinning nor was the microwave working. Plesser's refused to send the installers back and said we must take it up with Bosch who at first balked at replacing the unit. Our salesman - Peter Romano - was very supportive, and suggested calling Plesser's customer support. That was a dead end. The call went to voicemail, we left a message to call us back. We're still waiting for that return call. Bottom line - We waited over six weeks for a replacement microwave and Plesser's was no help at all. Installers were awful. Customer support was nonexistent. Salesman was excellent, but only so much he could do. The new unit was finally installed on June 17, 2019 thankfully not by Plesser's.. We like to shop locally, but will never go back to Plesser's.

Paid $3,400 for units and thought it would take a week or two to arrive. Much to my surprise, it took a week for an email that then required 2 plus weeks to arrive. It came with a tracking number from the private shipper but when I emailed to locate delivery, was told it was somewhere between New Jersey and Georgia, which is where it always would have been since I live in Georgia and it was from New Jersey.I was notified 24 hrs before delivery but not before then. So I was actually on stàndby for up to three weeks with a 24 hour notice. It arrived in terrible condition with the box visibly damaged and, to no ones surprise, the contents extremely damaged. Upon notifying all parties, Plessors offered me $250 off. Now I am in my 6th week waiting for a replacement freezer that I paid for 6 weeks ago.

Helpful Salesperson,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I bought 2 appliances from Plessers recently. Had a small problem with one which was fixed right away and the 2nd appliance was replaced. They took care of everything and it was not a problem to replace the cooktop which was defective. My salesperson Aziz was a pleasure to work with and I am happy to recommend him. I had a smaller size cut out for the cooktop and Aziz was able to find something that would fit without having my counter cut wider which I did not want to do. The installer Kyle was also amazing and he came back to my house on his own time to see if there was something wrong with the installation but it turned out to just be a defective appliance which was Frigidaire's fault and not Plessers. Great company to work with. Most people don't have any issues when they purchase an appliance so its says a lot about a company when an issue does arise that they take care of the problem and resolve any issues that you have.,2019-05-28T18:33:53.000Z

I am very impressed with their attention to detail in keeping me abreast of extended warranty I purchased, invoicing, anticipated delivery.  They are great merchants.  Unfortunately, the crew that delivered the refrigerator did NOT remove the refrigerator doors and scratched my home's trim paint while delivering the unit.  Their claim was that they would have to charge me for removing a few screws to remove the doors making their job easier.  I never did abide being ""rule wise and customer dissatisfied"" - i.e., client stupid.  This was not Plessers' fault.  The refrigerator, however, had a damaged grill cover behind the machine.  It was obviously kicked in intentionally.  The delivery people photographed the damaged and emailed it to Plesser customer service.  I telephoned customer service within the hour to learn the picture was viewed by Plesser mgmt.  They immediately offered me a credit or a repair.

But neither is true.When my refrigerator arrived, the delivery crew said they are only supposed to drop off the refrigerator in the room it goes.I showed them the actual receipt that showed I was paying for installation (and removal of the existing frig), but they called Plesser and they said that installation was not included for the $80 that I paid, despite it says clearly ""installation"".Otherwise, the refrigerator is good and works perfectly as it should.  I am very disappointed in Plesser's misleading advertisement of the $80 fee for installation and no rebate (as it is advertised).",2019-04-18T15:28:00.000Z

Plesser's vendor, AM Home Delivery, was supposed to arrive at my home on a Monday between 1-4 p.m. I called at 4:30 p.m., and was told by the driver that they were running late and would arrive between 6-7 p.m; they never showed (I left a message and emailed AM Home Delivery that night, but never received any follow-up communication). I called the delivery service again the next day to reschedule and was told I'd have to wait a full week until they were back in my area. I then called Plesser's customer service. They were great and were able to reschedule my delivery for that Wednesday. I was pleased with Plesser's quick response, but I was greatly inconvenienced, as was the contractor who was scheduled to install my appliances. It all worked out fine in the end, but I wish AM Home had been more communicative. Seeing as they are Plesser's chosen contractor, I'd be reluctant to order again.",2019-04-08T20:44:37.000Z

Plesser's deserves my 5 Stars,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"A friend of mine recommended Plessers as an excellent source for appliances to go in our kitchen remodel. Hesitant at first, but after shopping locally at numerous stores the deals at Plesser's couldn't be beat so I gave them a shot. The salesman I dealt with on the phone (John) was most excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the appliances, changed my mind a time or two, held off on delivery so they would arrive shortly before the remodel which was a couple of months after I ordered them. Plesser's kept in communication with me about my delivery date, tracking of the appliances, etc. AM Transportation here in Southern California scheduled a delivery date but I was out of town. They were very helpful in changing the delivery date to a day that suited me better. I received notification of the delivery, they showed up and unloaded the appliances and everything seemed to be in excellent shape. I still haven't installed, but getting closer. I would recommend Plesser's to anyone who is looking for new appliances at very good prices.",2019-04-04T19:10:24.000Z

Initially,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Initially, I was skeptical of making my purchase of appliances through E-comm, especially from a company that I had no prior history with. I decided to go forward with my purchase from Plesser's Appliance, It was the best decision that I could of possible made. We can all price shop for the best price, but.... Service cannot be shopped, or defined with empty words and promises. My view is the only difference in any purchase is the service after the sale. From the initial stroke of my key pad to hit purchase, Plesser's was on top of EVERYTHING. Their staff maintained contact through out the entire process, provided updates that were true and accurate. I had a small issue after receiving my new appliances, (no fault of Plesser's) the issue was immediately handled to my highest satisfaction by Frances. I will purchase all of my future appliances from Plesser's, telling all of my family and friends to do the same. Thank You for your great Service and Pricing !",2019-03-29T15:37:30.000Z

After having my fridge for 24 hours I discovered the water filter was leaking. I contacted Plesser they sent me to LG. A LG rep had me load an app on my phone so he could asses the issue. He discovered what was wrong and ordered a new part. Yesterday the certified tech came to put the part on only to discover the wrong part was ordered. So it is now 3/9/19 and I am not enjoying my new fridge yet as I have a bowl catching the leaking water. I am aware all of this is not Plesser fault but they are the ones I spent $2300.00 dollars with so they are the ones I hold most accountable for this.",2019-03-09T14:49:01.000Z

When I was ready to purchase every store in my area was sold out with nothing said about getting more. Also, I was not able to see the refrigerator in person.  Via the internet I found the fridge at Plesser's in New York.  I ordered online and the next day received an email acknowledging my order. In a few days they telephoned me. Plesser's customer service was exceptional. They covered all the details of my order and explained additional warranty benefits available.  It was a no brainer to sign up for extra coverage once it was explained. They arranged the shipping, which was free!  Plessar's monitored every step from purchase to set up in my home.  The delivery company was on time and called 30 minutes before their arrival. They were professional, polite, and friendly. I would highly recommend Plesser's Appliance to you.

Steer clear from this company,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Steer clear from this company.  Ordered a fridge. Spoke with customer service before ordering about length of time to receive. The rep was wonderful and helpful.  I was told my fridge was in stock, he put it on hold, and it would be a week to process the order, a week to ship.  One month.  One month is what it actually was.  No call.  No explanation.  No apology.  Nothing.  Called customer service and emailed them on social media.  Nothing. The call was met with a flippant, ""Well let's move forward"".  No acknowledgement of their misrepresentation, no effort to solve the problem.  Essentially just a ""get over it"" and ""you'll get it when you get it"".  (They did not use those words but that's what I heard with the flippant attitudes and the zero response from social media account)  Fast forward to delivery.  The one positive thing I will say is the fridge arrived in perfect shape.  However, the delivery company left the huge fridge box and ALL THE PACKING TRASH in our front drive.  We didn't know and didn't find it until next day after it rained all night.  Just assumed every moving company would take the trash since they always have before.  Wrong.   It's so much trash I can't even fit it in my can.  So will take me two weeks to get out.  Thanks, a-holes.  The grand finale to what was already craptastic service.

EXCELLENT PRICING & SALES TEAM,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"This review is solely based on our sales experience and extremely competitive pricing that we were offered.  I will re-write another review regarding the appliances once we take delivery.  First and foremost, we were greeted when we walked in the door by extremely pleasant and friendly sales professionals.  When we were asked if we needed assistance, like most of us our answer was, ""we are just looking.""  So, they gave us a little time to walk around and see some of the appliances on display, when salesman Eric Cullen approached us and answered all of our questions.  He was extremely knowledgeable about all of the appliances and he was patient as we continued to offer his kind assistance.  Once we decided on our purchase we also met Joe who took the time to make conversation with us regarding our kitchen flood, which was the reason we were shopping for all new appliances in the first place.  He too was extremely friendly and I can't say enough about how well we were treated and in no way was there any annoying sales pressure !!  Do yourselves a favor, don't waste your time going anywhere else.  This is the place where you will get a fair price, receive sound knowledgeable advise and most importantly be treated wonderfully by their experienced sales team.  Eric is a true asset to the sales team !!",2019-02-10T13:48:44.000Z

Order OK - Delivery unreliable,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"We ordered a stove with plessers, which was overall ok.It might be best before ordering to read very carefully the delivery times. With the purchase we were informed, that it can take up to 4 weeks till the stove will ship out of their warehouse, which can be a problem since the delivery company (AM trucking) is the next bottleneck. The stove shipped within 10 days after purchase from Plesser's warehouse, but the delivery did not go that smooth. We received notification with the scheduled delivery day and a time frame of 4 hours, which required someone to be at home on a Friday. 30 minutes before the delivery window was ending, we received a phone call that our delivery was 10 minutes away. Unfortunately the delivery never showed up and after 2 hours of waiting we go the information from AM truckings customer service, that the wrong stove was loaded on the truck and the driver just noticed it briefly before delivery. We were then told that beginning the following week we will receive a phone call to schedule the delivery again, which never happened. We had to call and investigate ourselves to find out on Wednesday the following week that the stove will be delivered on a Friday within a 4 hour time frame. There is no possibility to communicate a different delivery time, since there is no one to be reached from the trucking company besides the customer service people who block everything. If Plessers would work with a better Delivery Company I would give them a higher rating, but since they choose to stay with the low customer service oriented delivery service it was only an acceptable experience.",2019-02-05T21:54:55.000Z

I could not assess the condition of the appliances since they were all shrink wrapped & taped up (which the delivery men would not remove). Plessers tried to make it right after I reported the issue and let them know that the refrigerator door would not close. The salesman, Stephen, and customer care people were great.

Good Value but SLOWWWWWW Delivery,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I bought a specialty refridgerator from Plesser's for about $400 less than it would cost at a Best Buy or Costco.  They use a 3rd party frieght company for deliveries.  They said it would take 5-6 days after it was picked up from their warehouse and it took almost 3 weeks.  Not really Plesser's fault except in the expectation setting department.  When it finally did arrive it was as advertised annd I'm very satisfied with the cost.,2019-02-01T20:14:58.000Z

Delivery took away from positive experience,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"If the review were for the Plesser's experience alone, it would be 5 stars -- however, when you factor in the delivery aspect - which at best is a 1.5, I settle in at 3.  You get delivery call the day before delivery, late in the day.  If you miss the call and the time is not acceptable, you cannot get back in touch with trucking company.  I did not pay for white glove delivery of my Kitchenaid suite of appliances, but I would hope if you do, its different delivery guys.  These delivery guys were a mess.  They didnt want to go up a step to the front porch of a rancher.  They wanted to come thru back door - which is more narrow than front.  My husband, trying to be accommodating, removed the back door to make it easy for them.  They didnt help take it off.  They didnt help put it back on.  They were bulls in a china shop.  They left all kinds of nuts and bolts littered all over the sidewalk when they left.  Then as my husband was inspecting the appliances - which you have to do immeditely upon receipt  -which is a whole big mess taking all packaging off while these truck drivers are staring at you telling you everythings good just sign.

Product as expected; Unacceptable delivery service.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The product was fine, albeit slow to get picked and shipped to us. Customer service was friendly and helpful.The issue with the order was the delivery. Plesser's ships with A M Trucking, and while the trucking company isn't part of Plesser's it is still an important part of the overall customer experience.We were given an expected delivery date and told we would get a call the day before to confirm delivery. We didn't get a call until the morning of the scheduled delivery and that was to tell us that our Wednesday delivery wouldn't be made due to ""snow in Colorado"". According to the dispatcher in NJ, the next opportunity for delivery was the following week ""weather permitting"". It was a relatively warm day with blue skies and dry roads, which made us wonder how we would every get our delivery if it couldn't be made that day.To meet our client's schedule we ended up sending one of our drivers 1.5 hours one way to Denver to pick up the appliances ourselves.Note to Plesser's: the customer experience doesn't end when the product leaves your warehouse. The product can be perfect, but if we can't rely on getting it or have to pay to go get it ourselves, it isn't a good customer experience.",2019-01-31T20:56:29.000Z

Not only that I would recommend people to shop at Plesser for their appliance, I would say ask for Peter.My only issue was and is with the delivery guys. Although they were very nice, they left the open cartons for the appliances eighth on the steeet in front of my house which I had to cleanup. Also, they did not install the retina tarot door properly as it is uneven, and I Hope Plesser will send someone to fix it. Other than the delivery minuses, I would extremely recommend Plesser to anyone, because the price is great and the sale people are wonderful.I called them up, reported the issue with the refrigerator door, and within minutes they had it scheduled to be fixed. I could not be happier.That is real customer satisfaction and one of the best services I have received from any organization or vendor.

When our old fridge died suddenly,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"When our old fridge died suddenly, I knew we had a long night ahead of us as we tried to salvage what we could and get a new fridge as quickly as possible. Armed with data from on-line review sites and Consumer Reports on-line, my wife and I went over the top-rated models and narrowed our choices to two very similar models. Although nearly identical, one was priced several hundred dollars more than the other. We looked at several on-line and local retailers and found that, not only did Presser's have the best prices and among the highest reviews, but they had a real phone number we could call for more information. We were connected to a very knowledgable person in sales who looked the two models up and then went over the features of each in quite a bit of detail, even though the store had already closed by then. He also pointed out that with the on-sale discounts, the price difference was only half what we'd thought it would be.Later that evening, having made our decision, we made our purchase on-line with ease and charged it to PayPal. We were able to arrange for pickup of the old fridge for a nominal fee, and the cost of in-home delivery was covered by a rebate, which we were able to process on-line and which arrived fairly quickly. There were a few questions we had about the delivery that we ironed out over the phone the next day. Again, the sales staff were very knowledgeable, professional and helpful.A week later, our new fridge was delivered in a Plessers delivery truck by their local contractor. They sent a team of three delivery people and they were as professional as any delivery service we've ever used. They removed the old refrigerator and brought the new one up, but needed to remove the doors to get it inside. They could have simply reattached the doors and left, but recognizing that the doors would again have to be removed to install it, they connected the water line, plugged it in and installed it before reattaching the doors, even though we hadn't paid for installation. Before leaving, they checked it out thoroughly. They vastly exceeded our expectations.By the way, with a couple of collapsable ice chests from Target and a little over a hundred pounds of ice from the convenience store across the street, we managed to salvage nearly the entire contents of our old fridge. The new fridge is fantastic and we couldn't be happier with our selection, nor with Plessers.",2019-01-24T05:44:30.000Z

We were told the refrigerator  we ordered would take 7 to 10 days to be delivered.  Well it was actually 6 WEEKS.  What was most annoying  is that we were never informed of what was going on,  We always had to call and pretty much got a scripted answer.  Thankfully we were able to rent a refrigerator from a rental company ( not Plesser's)  , but this added to the overall cost.  So this time we were very dissatisfied .",2019-01-23T22:38:51.000Z

All is well that ends well!,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Couldn't beat the price. Delivery miscommunication resulting in appliance coming directly to me before kitchen renovation was finished. Sent to Plesser's local warehouse and then delivered on agreed date but with a dent in one freezer door. LG agreed to replace the dented door but the process to do so became long and tedious. LG shipped the wrong door twice. On the third attempt, the package was assumed lost due to wild fires in CA, the originating location. The correct door finally arrived weeks later than the stated delivery date and was installed by LG technician successfully. Plesser's customer service representative provided excellent follow-up throughout the process and advocated with LG several times on my behalf. All is well that ends well.",2019-01-15T17:42:58.000Z

Plesser's Appliance was great - will use again if need is not urgent.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Plesser's Appliance was great.  Good prices and dishwasher was exactly the model we ordered.  The picture on the website was not correct for the model we ordered, but the model number was correct, and we received the correct model.  The only reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is the choice of delivery services (AM Trucking).  The dishwasher shipped ~2 weeks after the order was placed.  The item arrived in the local warehouse a few days later but more than two weeks before they planned to deliver to my house.  I opted to pick it up at the warehouse.  The AM Trucking customer service setup the pickup appointment, but did not know the address of the Dallas warehouse!  After long waits on hold (>30 minutes each time) and multiple emails, I finally got the address about an hour from the scheduled pickup time.  I will say, however, that AM Trucking handled the shipment with great care.  Bosch does not wrap dishwashers with much protection (no box, just styrofoam edge guards, and shrinkwrap around the unit).  The shrinkwrap did not show any signs of distress, and there was no shipping damage of any kind to the dishwasher.",2019-01-10T02:07:57.000Z

We needed a new Oven and Microwave and were hoping to get before Christmas (entertaining).  We went to PC Richards.  The sales person was wasn't happy that we were asking questions, was showing us ovens we weren't interested in, eventually said ""I'll be right back"" and just left us.  Costco - good price, zero service.  Best Buy - the guy didn't know what he was talking about.  They nickel and dimed us (removal charge, delivery charge, hookup charge)  Stephen at Plessers was friendly, very helpful, gave us great advice and insight on any oven we asked about, and in the end helped us select the right one.  Plus, they matched Costco price, offered an extended warranty that was dirt cheap, AND delivered/installed by Christmas.  Awesome experience and Stephen was great.

The only reason I am giving this…,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I am giving this experience a 3 is due to communications and the vendor that Plessers uses for the out of state deliveries and installations.When we scheduled there was a failure to disclose that after the item to be delivered was picked up it was a 5, business day travel time to arrive to the warehouse in the state of delivery. After the item arrives in the state it is to be delivered in, there is about another 5  business days before they schedule to deliver to your home. While I know that AM is not a part of Plessers they are affiliated by the contract. The service from AM is horrid and they even failed to install the item I ordered correctly and they now seem to be having a difficult time getting back to me in a timely manner. Do not use this vendor for the install - make sure you ask the Plessers rep about delivery turn time as this was not shared with me until I hit a hardship in the process.Still can't use my machine - I called Speed Queens manufacture directly to confirm.",2019-01-09T17:32:27.000Z

It took quite some time, and a bit of dissasembling, but they did so very well.For our range, unfortunately their was a manufacturer issue.

unreasonably long shipping times with no correspondence.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The purchasing process was easy. A few clicks on the mouse, and my order was placed. What I’m extremely upset about is the fact that I ordered my cooktop back on November 24th, and it still hasn’t arrived over a month later.   This is unacceptable.  When I purchased this cooktop, I was aware that the shipping window for this item was 2 weeks. (Not 4-5) There are companies online that I could have purchased the same cooktop from that would have delivered it within one week. I won’t be purchasing anything else from them, due to this issue. Nobody from Plesser’s has even bothered to follow up with me throughout the entire duration. I’m not a happy customer.",2018-12-26T17:30:57.000Z

My, problems only began there.  I had listed my wife’s number as a backup, but that was given to the shipping company as primary. Therefore, I was forced to play phone tag even after confirming with them again to call mine. The shipping company works in a TWO day window. The first window they gave didn’t work, so I was forced to reschedule TWO weeks later at the earliest. I have to take off work to be home to sign and take delivery, a two day window is ridiculous. I haven’t even seen the condition or quality of the refrigerator I ordered yet but know beyond all doubt I’ll never order from Plessers again.",2018-12-24T17:50:21.000Z

There was no note when he emailed me the papers.,2018-12-24T16:55:20.000Z
ABSOLUTELY check Plessers out before you buy locally !!!!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was in the market for a new refrigerator, stove, dishwasher and OTR Microwave as part of a full kitchen remodel. I went to my local RC WIlley store and got their best price on the ones I wanted and before I dropped about $3,000, I took a flyer and went online to compare prices. I found Plessers, and at first couldn't believe that a company out of New York could ship the exact same items to my door in Sacramento, California, at over $600 LESS than a well respected store only 5 miles from my house ! I called the phone number just to make sure it wasn't a mis-print, and sure enough....same exact items, BETTER warranty, delivered FREE to my garage.....and over $600 LESS than my local retailer. Amazing place to do business, and my heartfelt thanks to Gene Coughlin.....the on-line sales manager who walked me thru an amazingly simple process, kept in contact with me and even led me to 3 rebates (worth over $200 !!) that my RC Willey retail salesperson conveniently neglected to tell me about. Would I buy from Plessers again ?? Absolutely...without a doubt. And yes, they DID ship the items from New York....for FREE !! And ?? No sales tax (that may not be a big thing to ya'll...but in California, it's like 8% on top of the sales price !!).  Yes, there was a 9-10- day delivery wait, but for $600+, I was happy to wait. Everything arrived on time, exactly as scheduled and it's now installed in my completely renovated kitchen. Thanks again Gene, and to Plesser's for making me now believe a new version of the old adage that ""if it seems too good to be true, it really CAN be true !!!"".",2018-12-23T01:28:48.000Z

Delivery service was also great and no issues.  Unit has been installed now for 5 days and so far so good.

They eventually walked over my carpet and I had to vacuum after they leave.2) Delivery guys had to take the refrigerator doors off to get the unit into my house. They then put it together.

Plessers' Appliance: A pleasure to deal with,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"My first experience with Plesser's Appliance was a pleasant one. I knew which model LG fridge I wanted -- rated #1 of its type by Consumer Reports -- and had done comparison shopping. Plesser's had by far the best price. Salesperson Jennifer was extremely helpful during the order-placement process on November 12, 2018.So why only 4 stars? Shipping/delivery date issues. I was in no rush to get the new fridge. My old one (bought in 1994) worked just fine. However, confusion arose because the online shipping schedule showed the fridge left the store on November 16 and was due for delivery on December 4. I checked my phone to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I hadn't. The refrigerator didn't arrive until December 12, 2018.After removing our front door to accommodate it, the AM Trucking team installed the fridge, leveled it, and hauled away my old fridge.  A few tiny marks on the left side of the cabinet are the only flaws I've found thus far. So I am happy with my new, roomy and quiet LG bottom-freezer refrigerator. And Consumer Reports is right. November is the best month to purchase refrigerators!",2018-12-15T17:21:02.000Z

After numerous phone calls, we discovered it was about 2 hrs away sitting in a warehouse waiting for other appliances/deliveries to be needed in our area before they would make the trip.  So we had to drive the 4 hrs RT & pick it up to have it by when we needed it. The refrigerator itself it what we ordered, arrived without damage, & is working great so far.

TERRIBLE TIME WITH DELIVERY,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The people at Plessers were very helpful, the appliance is very nice and I saved a lot of money.  The trouble was the delivery - too long to list all the issues here - in a nutshell - you get your delivery day and time just a day ahead without any input - very hard to manage when working - 1st date was supposed to be 7:30 on a Friday night - they never showed said truck broke down - I had everything out of the frig no contact from company all weekend - sent me up with random day again - my husband having surgery (and I told them beforehand) - next was a Thurs night the drivers called at 6pm from a DIFFERENT STATE which my appliance had been delivered to a city very close to mine to begin with!! - and said he wouldn't be to my house until 11pm!!!!! and that he had been making deliveries since 3am - I said cancel delivery! - finally it was delivered that Saturday I had paid $100 for ""White Glove Instalation""  when the men arrived they said they would have to charge more to remove my existing frig - they did set the new frig up but I wouldn't at all call it ""White Glove"" - usually the cardboard and all is taken out of the appliance and all that it wasn't - also later when we went outside after they had left we notice that they left the refrigerator box in our yard - really a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with delivery - Plessers did reach out to me I was told they were going to try and help with customer service - maybe help with some refund of the $100 but I have not heard back",2018-11-29T02:03:41.000Z

Laury was able to assist in researching our area and once she found out that there was no one to assist, was able to allow us to exchange the oven range and dishwasher.  Most recently, with the installation of the newer products, the moving company that installed the products did a poor job of installation, she was able to step in and work with the manager of the moving company and get this issue resolved.",2018-11-28T18:42:47.000Z

Also no other dealer made the $100.00 rebate known on their site. Even the big box stores couldn't compete with this price.At the time of this review, the refrigerator isn't installed, so I can't comment on functionality.I will say double check the delivery time frame. I was showing in the 4-5 business days for delivery and it took 3 weeks.

They came through with a good shipper for us in upstate New York. However, two things I am critical of: (1) They promote everywhere that the price is ""no sales tax"", yet we paid full sales tax - I do understand that an instate company, will require taxes for an instate customer but they made it look like that was not part of their sales nor a consideration. (2)  The time to finally to receive shipment was far too long - about 1 month. If you have the patience and you won't get too worried about delivery time, then they are for you.

Most disappointing, the person from Plessers who send me such warm regards and had no problem calling me during the sales process, failed entirely to respond to me when I wrote to request help with (a) the delay in getting the product here - I had noted how important it was to deliver before a particular date; (b) the failure of the trucking company to  deliver during the timeline provided; (c) the difficulty rescheduling delivery -- either their proposed time or 4-5 days delay; (d) the sudden cancellation of the delivery on the day we were waiting with our electrician for it to arrive.  If Plessers had just been there to help out I would not have felt so disappointed and concerned about any future interaction required related to guarantees, etc -- but they were only there to make the sale.  This is not a good way to do business -- while I love the product, I could surely have bought it elsewhere with much better service.",2018-11-14T23:07:27.000Z

The next day when I made my buy, the price had increased by $200. I made the purchase anyways due to the 10 year warranty, free shipping, and no tax. The following day I checked and the price had lowered $200. I called and voiced my concern. The $200 was refunded to my credit card without an issue. The range was delivered, but it had a dent on the side that wouldn't be seen after it would be installed, but the delivery driver made a picture of the dent before he left, and said he would forward it to Plesser's. A few days later I was contacted by Plesser's customer service who apologized said they would write a check for an amount that I thought was more than generous for the damage. Thank you Plesser's!",2018-11-09T19:32:53.000Z

LG Refrigerator with French doors,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"An LG refrigerator was purchased at an excellent price, perhaps $200 below what it would have cost us to get it locally at Home Depot in Oakland California, plus we saved paying local taxes. Our experience with Plesser's Appliance and with salesperson John was fine. The problem was that delivery is subcontracted with a company called AM Transportation Logistics, and that is where the disconnect happened. We live in a condo building where there are strict rules that appliances need to be delivered between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM. It took three tries to make that happen and they still arrived 40 minutes before 9 AM! The two previous tries would have had it arrive far too late (after 5 PM). in addition, the first time it was to be delivered, our instructions to include pickup of the old machine and installation were not included in the instructions that reached AM Transportation Logistics. In short, we spent a minimum of three hours on hold or talking to AM Logistics, in New Jersey, and learned that they had no immediate control over delivery. The man who actually delivered the refrigerator said that they had received absolutely no instructions regarding the window of delivery time. A truck is loaded with appliances and is given at least a 500 mile radius for deliveries, allowing for little or no wiggle room in terms of delivery time, and the workmen are apparently unaware of any special instructions on the delivery of a given appliance. It would be kind to potential purchasers to let them know of these potential problems in terms of delivery from this subcontractor.",2018-11-08T21:06:30.000Z

I completely forgot to meticulously inspect the box for any possible damage and it turns out the refrigerator I ordered has 1 dent and 2 scratches. When you see the box it simply looks fine but it was not until I installed the refrigerator that I noticed such dent and scratches.  The scratch in the front is simply horrible since it is in the front handle. I checked the box and there it was, a small hole. Whatever the refrigerator was hit with it perforated the box and damaged the handle. It is an expensive refrigerator so it matters for it to arrive in mint condition.

This type of delivery causes problems if there is something wrong with the item upon delivery (which we have experienced in the past) and the recipient has no way to prove if the damage occurred before delivery or after plessers drooped it off.

Water from my kitchen, through my floor and into my basement. Called Plesser’s and policy is that once installed, Bosch has to support via warranty claim. How does one verify a dishwasher works without hooking it up? No return, no refund, BUT they did offer to help expedite repair via Bosch. The service with Bosch is abysmal on the best of days and that is another story.

One of the best on-line purchase…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"One of the best on-line purchase experiences we have ever had.  We had our reservations -- especially considering we were spending nearly $20,000!  However, our sales consultant, John D. was with us every step of the way.  He even found us a discontinued refrigerator model, brand new, that the wife had her heart set on, out of stock everywhere else in the country.  And, so you will understand the level of trust we placed in this team -- this sale was shipped from New York to San Diego, CA.  A couple of small damage items did occur.  Plesser's customer service team was great to work with and coordinated warranty responses from the appliance manufacturers.  Our brand-new kitchen and all our appliances simply sparkle! Best prices around, easy to work with.  Free shipping included local delivery and inside set-up, installation was extra.  Good service after the sale.  One negative.  When we were shopping by phone, we were offered a $1,500 incentive ""discount"" for putting 50% down and placing our order by phone that day and retaining our appliances in the warehouse, even though our remodel would not be ready for the shipment and receipt of these appliances for a couple more months.  We were never able to get that ""discount"" to appear anywhere in any of the paperwork ... Unfortunately that meant they got to use $10,000 of my money a lot longer than I did -- and -- I received ZERO benefit for it  :-(All in all, still a great value.

Plessers could not have made my appliances purchase any easier,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Barry from Plessers was so helpful on the phone with me, that I actually canceled the order I had with another company and ordered it from him -- right on the phone! He was knowledgeable and informative, answered all my questions, and even suggested a great warranty (which I hope to never have need for)! The necessary paperwork was sent to me complete, promptly, and efficiently. The delivery staff was helpful, neat and pleasant. I am loving my new refrigerator and stove, and I'm confident I can call them at any time if I have questions or any problems.

Sales excellent,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Sales excellent. Very pleasant to deal withDelivery is awful. I paid to have the fridge brought into the room which required removing the doors. They mess up the two french doors. One was more than 3/8"" higher than the other. They left it like that knowingly. I diagnosed the issue to a hinge miss-installed on the left door. They came the next day to fix the issue. They insisted they remove the right door first and ignored my hypothesis. After that didn't work they proceeded to remove the left door. My original diagnosis was spot on. I HAVE PICTURES. Both times they left very deep grease marks all over the fridge. We have been trying to remove them but they can still be seen. There was no need for any of this to happen.",2018-10-11T23:11:42.000Z

Delivery Disaster without support,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The shopping experience started off very positive, the price was good, the discussion went well, but the shipping process was a mess and ruined the experience.I knew what I want and purchased due to the best price and a positive experience with a purchase in the past.However, I started off by calling the number and reaching no one, but I did get a prompt call back.  I explained the situation, asked if the Labor Day sale price would be cheaper, and expressed my concern with a lack of shipping delivery date on the website.  I expressed my concern about delivery and I needed the washing machine soon and couldn't wait long, or I would buy local and pick up.  I was given a very clear date of delivery over the phone.  I completed the order.As explained, the washing machine sale was processed, I got notified that it shipped on the day that was indicated during the phone call, and received an email with estimated delivery dates which matched what was told over the phone.However, this all turned out to be untrue.  Several days later I was contacted by the shipping company and given a date a week later.  I called the sales rep and expressed my concern and he contacted to ""expedite"".  As the delivery date approached and passed, I reached out several times to both the sales associate and shipping company, only to have the date slide out even further.  After more discussions, I was told that the date given wasn't what was given and I should have bought local with pickup if I needed sooner (which was why I made the call in the first place).  Still, they told me that they would expedite to deliver on the original confirmed delivery date from the shipping company (a week after Plessers indicated via phone and email confirmation).  That date came and went, and finally got a notification of delivery, but was given a multihour window for delivery.  I once again contacted them and said that I was given a less-than-24-hour notice and wasn't available that day until 5pm, rather than the 3-7pm window.  They said no problem and they'd accommodate and would call one hour in advance.So, the day of delivery, I was (of course) called at 2:40pm saying they'd be there by 3pm (20min notice and at a time I wasn't available).  I told them they'd need to reschedule for later that evening, as discussed, and was told they couldn't accommodate.  So, I end up changing my scheduled afternoon and taking time off work last minute to drive home.  On the way home, I get a call asking where I'm at and if I'm not there and won't confirm I'll be there, the driver will be routed to the next stop instead and I'll have to talk to someone the following week to reschedule based on next stop.  I had to tell them I was minutes away and ask them to stay a few.  I arrived 15 minutes later and the driver indicated he just pulled up (so wasn't 20min away).  He was nice and apologized and told me that they get complaints daily based on how poor the communication was.  Driver and assistant were courteous, friendly, sympathetic, and helpful.Plessers was unhelpful, shipping company awful, driver was great.",2018-10-01T20:43:50.000Z

A problem that we discovered after installation with the 3rd rack obstruction due to the top of the unit being depressed. This was solved by Plesser arranging for warranty service. However, the delivery process was less than professional. The notification was sent to us one day before the home delivery company wanted to deliver. I notified them that we had a prior commitment and their schedule could not be accommodated, They showed up to deliver on that day anyway. It took another 10 days for the home delivery company to actually schedule and make the delivery. I consider this a problem that Plesser should address. Also, I advise anyone ordering a Bosch dishwasher to check proper operation of all the internal racks, not just examine for external damage. I can only guess where the top of the unit was depressed to the point that the 3rd rack would not extend.",2018-09-27T22:35:01.000Z

The day I went online to make the purchase, the sale price did not appear.

He said Plesser's could honor the price I mentioned but I later found out the actual sale price was $1079. I paid $20 extra. My main issue was with the shipping company. The tracking information on the website indicated the refrigerator was picked up September 6. The online shipping map indicates 5-7 day delivery time. The delivery was made 14 days later. I paid $50 for the Gold Delivery. All of the packing materials except the cardboard were left on the side of the house.

The sale and logistics were handled by Plesser's flawlessly, with a friendly phone call to ensure I was getting exactly what I wanted. The delivery day was a little bumpier. I wish that vendors would not contract out this function, because it makes a difference. Refrigerator arrived with small dent on the side, and delivery contractor was in a hurry to get in and out quickly. I was not able to fully unpack and inspect prior to signing for the fridge. Thankfully, no further damage was discovered. Your experience may vary with such a big variable - reliable delivery - left to a third party.

They kept me informed about tracking the appliances which were delivered with prior specific notification, and flexible to allow me to plan the delivery timing.  Perfect, fast performance. They did everything they said they would do, when they said they would do it, at a very enticing price. Would definitely buy from them again and recommend to anyone.",2018-09-20T03:09:21.000Z

Unfortunately, the refrigerator could not be delivered in that window (while I was at the vacation house) and then no one was available afterwards to take delivery.  Plesser's customer support was sympathetic and worked with me to arrange a time where my husband could make the trip out again (4 hr drive) to take delivery.  As he was there alone, Plesser gave us complimentary ""gold"" delivery (delivered to a room of your choice) as my husband was alone and could not get the fridge inside by himself.  Communication with Plesser's was very good and I felt fairly treated.  I wish Plesser's had told me upfront they could not meet the delivery window (I probably would have ordered from elsewhere), but given the circumstances, things turned out reasonably and I would consider Plesser's for future purchases.",2018-09-14T01:55:42.000Z

Aziz and were quoted a delivery timeframe of a week to a week and half to receive our products (8/22/18 thereabouts). A week and half went by with no word of any status, so I reached out to follow up. Aziz advised he was unable to get in touch with ANYONE from Thermador and would keep trying. Another week goes by along with many follow up phone calls to Aziz and he advised he FINALLY spoke to someone at Thermador and was given a timeframe of a week. (A week and half OVER the original quoted timeframe) Now, we are looking at a date of 8/27 and my patience was wearing a bit thin at this point. I requested to at least have my other appliances delivered. That was set up rather smooth thanks to Kat. Upon receiving the appliances, we had an issue with the microdrawer. It was not heating what so ever. I then touched base with the manager, Joe Jackson, and advised of my frustration of the stove situation as well as notified him of the microdrawer issue. Joe, was very accommodating. He advised he would send a new microdrawer and he did. About a week later, both Joe and Aziz called with “great news” they FINALLY had a date of 8/31/18 for the arrival date to the warehouse. Not sure how it’s great news when it’s 3 weeks over the original quoted time but I was relieved to at least have a date. Come 8/31, I received yet another phone call from Joe stating the stove is NOW coming in Tuesday, 9/4 and was delayed due to the holiday. Tuesday came and went, no stove, however yet another phone call now from Kat stating “great news” the stove is scheduled to be in the warehouse Thursday 9/6.

Everyone at the company was so darned pleasant that I felt really taken care of.  It took about 4 weeks to deliver vs overnight with home depot but by waiting I saved over 2,000.00 on my purchase and...it was worth the wait.  I opted for inside gold delivery so the day before they arrived to deliver they called me and i had everything all set up for arrival.

The delivery guys did not have tools(I had tools for them to use) nor did they ""have the time"" to do the work I paid for.But Plessers did agree to refund the extra for in home delivery. Fortunately for me I had the tools and the smarts to watch a YouTube video on how to perform the door and drawer removal. With a handtruck, a couple furniture blankets, a strap(not too tight) and patience I got it in and installed successfully.I feel bad for the elderly or anyone else that doesn't have a way to move a 400lb fridge.",2018-07-27T22:15:38.000Z

Would not buy from Plessers again,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bought a gas stove and it came badly damaged. It was clearly dropped or something was dropped on it.  Had a plumber here and was going to install stove as he put in a gas line. Returned stove for a new one. Took over a month for new stove (so i was without a stove the whole time as i converted the 220 outlet to a 110 to accommodate gas vs electric).Price was 20 dollars lower now and they ignored every request for reasonable refund. I paid to have installed the first time but their crappy delivery made it unable to be installed. They would not offer installation for the 2nd time.Emails and phone calls completely ignored. Nightmare process and will do Home Depot or something next time as i have never had a problem getting appliances through them.Be cautious!,2018-07-24T23:21:21.000Z

Plessers.com is highly recommended,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I was in need of all my kitchen appliances last year in March.  After looking around in many stores, I found about Plessers.com.  I knew what I wanted that made easy for me to shop online and on phone.  We got amazing deal from Plessers.  I bought all 5 kitchen appliances.  Most of them came within 4 weeks except microwave oven.  Their customer service people are excellent, prompt and very courteous.  One of my refrigerator bin was little crooked.  I thought, Plessers will not do anything in spite of 5 years warranty.  After thinking for long time what to do, I recently emailed Plessers.  Ms. Dere Sperling from their customer service replied me asking for detail about my refrigerator.  She called me and told me that it will not covered under warranty because it is cosmetic.  She told me that she will tried her best to get it for me otherwise she will find out the cost for it.  She called me few days later saying that she was able to order it without cost.  I’m very pleased with her effort to order the bin I needed.  I wish there are customer service personal like Dere Sperling.  I highly recommend Plessers to anybody due to their competitive price and excellent customer service.",2018-06-28T04:33:53.000Z

They also failed to inform the shipping company to turn around the first shipment, which I hadn’t received yet so I had to store a refrigerator for 2 weeks until the replacement order was received.

Prices are great! Expectations not so much,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Sales experience was great. They told me that if I ordered via phone it would take 2 weeks to get my appliances compared to ordering on there website would be 3 weeks.  It wasn’t communicated to us when purchasing or placing the order that one appliance was on manufacturer back order. So they were holding all 3 of the other items that were in. I called a couple of times to figure out what was going on. They finally approved to do a split shipping.  The shipping is horrible! They take over 3 weeks for you to actually get your items. They don’t keep there website updated! Also, once your item gets to the warehouse they hold it for over a week then call you for delivery. I called the company and all they could do is send an email to the warehouse and told me they would call me over 4 days later that is. The delivery guys were friendly and nice. But yes all the protection And stirafoam it comes with gets thrown in your front yard and they helped bring in the items. The company plessers sends you an email that items need to be inspected for damage prior to the truck guys leaving. But the company just wants to get your stuff in your home and they want out of there ASAP. We weren’t able to inspect everything before they were down the road. Not sure if paying $80 is worth that service you get. The fridge does have a dent in the door. For the company plessers there prices are great yes, but due to us needing our items  by a timeframe that they said would be no problem ended up costing us more money than what we saved with buying through them instead of staying local.  Also, due to the delay in everything we actually lost our rebates because they require you to have the serial number of your items to be able to receive your rebate which the Company doesn’t give you that information.",2018-06-01T05:46:03.000Z

I decided to give it a go, when I  compared prices to a Home improvement store, saving $500 on the exact same items. Delivery was a couple of weeks later and went very smooth. I did uncrate the refrigerator and oh no, there was a pretty good ding in one of the doors. I contacted Plesser's customer service by email and they responded the next day, saying that they would ship a new door to me. WOW!  Totally satisfied and would highly recommend!",2018-05-25T21:28:06.000Z

I am old and Southern,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I am old and Southern living right outside of Nashville, TN and as to be expected was apprehensive dealing with a company out of NY, especially on a ""deal"" that appeared to be ""too good to be true.""  However, once I read a large number of reviews and looking at the BBB, etc., I decided to take the plunge IF when I talked to a real human I felt comfortable with whom I was dealing or if my ""short hairs"" stood up.... up came a lady named Jennifer O'Brien.  Within a few minutes I felt as comfortable as dealing with someone local that I knew.  We talked about things we had in common, etc., and I felt totally at ease.  The item I bought was  a washer/dryer combo and sent  ""...a  payment of $1,649.00 USD to PLESSERS APPLIANCE (One of the several perks included was FREE SHIPPING.  Anyway, I ordered and crossed my fingers and inevitably something happened (they emailed saying the order was cancelled and money refunded).  I immediately contacted Jennifer and this came back...Hi johnNo worries! Your order was not cancelled.The order you made on line did go through, so you had 2 identical orders! So they canceled 1 of them so you didn’t end up with 2 units This is your active order # 146190.Enjoy!Jennifer took care of it by the end of that very day and from then on it was smooth sailing.  The unit arrived safety when it was supposed to, unharmed, and my wife has now used it for over two weeks and loves it once she got used to it.  IT DOES have a learning curve for sure as it is an LG VENTLESS washer/dryer combo.Would I buy from Plesser's again?...ABSOLUTELY and I would recommend anyone to due their due diligence and run, don't walk, straight to Jennifer.  To me, she is now a known entity, a real human being I would deal with no matter where she works but just so happens she is at Plesser's...a very smart outfit to hire folks like her that relates to us Southern ""rednecks"" and can speak southerneze. :o) as well as anyone else I would imagine.

People at the main office in NY are very nice. however, they use third party to deliver the item. They do not deliver on weekend. I work. they give from 2 pm to 6 pm delivery, supposed to call 1 h before the delivery. But it was 8 pm by the time they delivered. Two African american men brought the stove. they opened the top cover box and throw it to the wall. I told them not to put against the wall because this is a new house. I pulled the cover from the wall and the person goes back and push it to the wall again. I just could not figure out why they do that even after telling not to. But the item came with out damage. it is yet installed yet. I would have given 5 stars if the delivery people are more accommodating and were respectful to the property.",2018-04-25T04:38:07.000Z

Get delivery timing verified and in writing.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Timing was the most important aspect of this purchase. No one wants to be without a dw, particularly when you have lots of company coming. The dishwasher I was ordering was not immediately available from any local suppliers, so I decided we could wait a few extra days and save some money by ordering at Plessers. In hindsight, I should have paid more for better service. Plesser's Internet Sales Manager assured me that I would receive the DW within 13 days. Plessers did not even ship it out until 9 days after I ordered! It took much longer than promised. I am fine with a longer lead time when I know what to expect, but I felt tricked by Plesser's. And the person in the shipping dept was rude to me and wanted to lecture me about their 2 week lead time before shipping. He told me that they were ""ahead of time."" (Nothing in my invoice or other emails from Plessers ever described the timing he mentioned.) I am still waiting to receive the information about the 5-year warranty I purchased from them. I guess that will take a few more phone calls as well. I did not give one star because of a salesperson, Azi, who went out of his way to try to get my order expedited and the Internet Sales Manager called to sort of apologize for the ""misunderstanding.""",2018-03-29T21:13:41.000Z

Terrible returns policy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a refrigerator with Plesser's, and due to a miscommunication between our contractor and our cabinet designer, the fridge ended up being too deep to fit in the space. We had taken it out of the box, of course, and removed the plastic film to put it into the space. I am used to dealing with stores like Home Depot and Lowe's who have great return policies-- you can even return used items and they don't bat an eye. When I looked at Plesser's return policy and was in contact with them, they told me that they would not accept it because the plastic film had been removed, even though it had never been used. Not only that, but if they had accepted our return, they would have charged at least a 25% restocking fee plus shipping, which would have totaled close to $900 to return it! That is just crazy. We also wanted to purchase a different model from them that would have fit better, so you would think they would work with us as we were still planning on giving them our business. I wish I would have read the return policy more closely before deciding to purchase from Plesser's, but even so I never imagined their policy could be this bad. I have learned my lesson to always go with Home Depot or Lowe's, even if they are a bit pricier, than to use Plesser's.",2018-02-16T21:17:35.000Z

To their credit, they owned up to the mistake right away; sent the correct appliance, and compensated me for the trouble- great customer service on that end.

I would never buy anything from them again...,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had a very bad experience with Plesser's Appliances.  They told me the the appliances I was ordering were in stock, but they weren't.  After delivering the appliances two weeks later then promised, they delivered them to the wrong address.  Once that was corrected, both new  appliances arrived damaged.  They said that they would give me a credit of $145.00 if I accepted the damaged stove, which I did, but it's been 5 weeks and I still haven't received my refund.  The other appliance (a microwave), I chose not to accept damaged.  Once the new microwave arrived, they said they would install it because of all the inconveniences, but the delivery company could not install it.  I complained about that and they said they would give me another refund of $130.00, but I haven't received that yet either.  Their customer service is very poor, I would email and call them multiple times and they said they would call me back, but never did, until I caught them live.  Overall, I would not recommend buying anything from them.  They say they have the things in stock, but once the time expires to cancel your order, they let you know that it's out of stock and they won't refund you your money, so you have no choice but to wait.  I would not recommend buying anything from them unless you are prepared to deal with a lot of headaches.",2018-02-10T17:43:37.000Z
Why you should shop at Plessars!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"We purchased a new home and are doing a major renovation to it. It can be somewhat stressful : no kitchen, keeping the pets safe, dust and more dust. Appliance delivery was very smooth. Propane company came to hook up stove - noticed stove was natural gas not LP. I freaked out when I looked at the receipt and saw it showed Natural gas.- I never noticed it, which was my fault- we bought a lot of appliances that day, and went back and forth between plessars and their competition in Huntington,  Before settling on Plessars.   My husband and I had told our  salesperson LP many times. I called my sales person - he wasn’t in. I asked for the manager Joe. Joe could not have been nicer!!! I told him our story and hE apologized to me, and told me he would fix it. He even let me keep the wrong stove for two weeks so the counters could be templated- while thermador built my LP stove. Amazing experience! Joe you are a pleasure to deal with and because of you, I will recommend Plessars forever. Sincerely Jackie - Baiting Hollow, NY",2018-02-10T12:25:19.000Z

"Are these guys legit? We weren't sure, but they came through!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"We ordered a Whirlpool refrigerator during the 2017 Black Friday sale.  The sales person warned me that refrigerator was over-sold and would have to be manufactured and shipped to local distribution centers before it could be scheduled for delivery.  After waiting perhaps 45 days (I was starting to feel nervous that I had been scammed), I reached out to Plessers' customer service department to see if they could give me an update.  They were busy, but responded the next day and told me the refrigerator was finally en route from the manufacturing plant to a local distribution hub.  In less than 2 weeks from then, the refrigerator was delivered.  We do love the appliance.The appliance delivery contractor was a little rough around the edges, but they got the job done.  Since these delivery guys travel far and wide and don't really care about you (like your small home-town appliance company would), consider having someone at home who can assist with verifying the appliance's travel path is clear and closely interact with the crew to be sure they don't bang up any walls and door frames.",2018-02-07T12:37:45.000Z

No customer satisfaction!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a microwave and a trim kit from Plessers. I paid extra for a site survey to make sure the microwave would fit correctly in the existing location. The installer came to my house and took  measurements gave them to the sales rep and he ordered the microwave and trim kit for the specific opening. When the installer came to install the microwave and trim kit he said their was a problem and it would not fit and had to use my old trim kit to make it fit. When I called my sales rep and told him what happened that I paid extra for this microwave and trim kit and installation and that you took measurements prior to installation so that everything would fit properly, and that he could  not use the new trim kit which was much nicer than my old trim kit He said it looks good with the old trim kit the installer did a good job!!!!!   Bottom line :Even though Plessers was at fault with incorrect measurements from the site survey by the installer or the sales rep ordered the incorrect microwave something should have been done to correct the situation !!!The customer should not have to settle for something he didn’t order and pay for !!!Poor or No customer satisfaction !!!!!!!!!!",2018-01-23T18:19:59.000Z

I did and the order did get changed (the change was of a different model#)Due to the cold spell, esp in NY, I waited for info of when will the shipment be scheduled for this Gas cooktop.

"Communication, fulfillment, and delivery = TERRIBLE",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Although you can't beat Plesser's prices, their communication, fulfillment, and delivery services are terrible. My order did not ship for over a month, with no communication. I had to inquire twice to figure out what the status of my order was, and I received very short emails back that were hard to understanding, placing the fulfillment issues on me as the customer. When the items did ship, it was very difficult to make delivery arrangements. The delivery company was not flexible in their scheduling and could not deliver on a date that worked for me, so I took a day off work. The delivery window was 2:00-6:00pm and they arrived at 7:15pm! The delivery crew did not follow through with the ""in home delivery"" and literally dropped these off at the end of my driveway. I am now stuck with making arrangements for another service call to have the appliances moved into my kitchen. I am very disappointed with the professionalism and customer service that Plesser's has provided me as a customer.",2018-01-17T00:20:16.000Z

That same evening I received a call informing me that my product was not coming on Friday. (So much for the surprise.) Some type of error in shipping. I was then called on Friday (12-22-2017) to be told the shippers would call to schedule my delivery for Tuesday 12-26-2017. I did not receive a call on Friday. I got the call on Tuesday and finally received my refrigerator on Wednesday 12-27-2017. Simple communication and verification would have gone a long way here.

You get what you pay for.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I thought I was getting a better price than Home Depot. I ended up waiting almost 3 weeks for a damaged item. Plessers said that they would replace it, but it would be 14 days  AFTER the damaged one was picked up and received before I'd get a replacement. I ended up having to buy another range from Home Depot 7 days ago and they still have not scheduled a pick up of the damaged range. When I made my purchase with Plessers, they sent me mail in rebates that I could use once I received the product that would bring the price down even more. Too good to be true. I received the product after the expiration date of the rebates. Even if the product wasn't damaged, I wouldnt have been able to use the rebates.",2018-01-10T14:54:22.000Z

"2 months to receive ""In Stock"" product",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a range from Plessers that was listed as in stock, shipping within 2-3 weeks on Oct 30. It did not arrive until Dec 30. Their customer service dept called me a few days after my order, confirming that the unit was in stock and shipping out that week. As I'd now had two confirmations from Plessers about it being in stock, I scheduled my kitchen remodel demolition for three weeks out.Two weeks go by, I never get a shipment notification. I call Plessers and they say that the person that told me that the range was in stock was wrong, they don't have any but it'll be in stock and shipping out to me within a few days. They assured me they'd follow up with me by phone once it came in. I never hear from her again.Another two weeks go by, I'm now without a stove or oven since the other parts of my remodel needed to move along. I contact customer service again, to be told the range is still not in stock and they think maybe it'll ship early December but they don't know. It did not ship until Dec 19, and was not at my house until Dec 30.Don't waste your time or your money on Plesser's.

Plessers Top-Notch Customer Support,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"We ordered a Samsung Dishwasher from Plessers and received it within two weeks, delivered to our kitchen. The delivery contractor spoke very little and was gone before we had a chance to remove the packing from the dishwasher to inspect it. Everything seemed to be in order so we weren't concerned. After we were able to get it unpacked however, we found that the stainless steel door had been dented to the point that the edge of the door was deformed and creased. We immediately sent Plessers an email explaining the damage and from that point forward, we received the most amazing, personal support from Alicia Fleming who worked for us as though we were her only responsibility. Phone calls were always answered or promptly returned and we were always kept up to date with the status of scheduling the replacement of the damaged door. Ms. Fleming handled everything for us -- ordered, inspected and shipped the replacement door to us. Worked with a local repair facility to schedule service to have the door installed and repeatedly followed up with us at every step to make sure everything was properly taken care of.We would certainly HIGHLY recommend Plessers Appliances for offering unbeatable prices on the best appliances but their Customer Service, as provided to us by Alicia Fleming who went above and beyond to give us truly personal attention, is nothing less than outstanding !",2017-12-31T20:30:27.000Z

Would seriously advise against purchasing from Plessers if you're having anything delivered,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The experience started off fine, but in the end, the delivery company for Plessers botched everything up and were completely inflexible. The delivery company leaves a message on your voicemail (if they can't reach you the first time they call) with a delivery date/time, and it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to reach them again if you need an adjustment of any kind. And if you can't do a random day of their choosing, you have to wait a full week or more for the delivery. Not cool around Christmas time in an area where the weather is unreliable and SOME flexibility is required. Every incompetent rep I spoke with at the delivery company took 20 minutes to reach. Each rep gave me different answers on when they deliver to my area, how it works, etc. and the first 5-6 reps I spoke with had NO idea how to reschedule. They even put my appliance on the truck and were on their way to deliver -- tho I called the day before and explained I COULDN'T be there on the day they chose to deliver. Then I had to wait a week for another chance of delivery. No other option. FULL DISCLOSURE: The house they were delivering to is in the country -- about 2.5 hours from Manhattan so, understandably, they don't come every day. But because my delivery was in the country, they only would deliver one day in the week with absolutely NO flexibility. The day they tried to deliver, it had snowed overnight and although my driveway had been plowed, it had a couple of inches after some more snow fell. I told the truck drivers I would get the plow guy up here in 15 minutes (which I did) but they were on a tight schedule and just left. They told me someone would contact me from their company. Radio silence. At that point, I called customer service at Plessers. Got voicemail. I emailed. No reply. I must have called again 4-6 times -- out of my mind, trying to figure out what to do NOW? I'd taken off from work to get this delivery at a second home so it was really stressful. The delivery company was SUPPOSED to call me to discuss. They didn't. So for over four hours, I could reach NO ONE to discuss ""What happens now??"" I cancelled the order, even when nearly 6 hours later customer service emailed me to say they'd deliver next week (AFTER Christmas -- when I ordered right after Thanksgiving with the expectation of having the new appliance FOR Christmas). So I told them to refund my money. The whole process wasn't worth the stress. The one thing I can say that was good was Plessers tried to convince me NOT to cancel, offered me another discount of $125 if I would wait until the next week. I didn't accept that. (And P.S. - there was a snowstorm on the specific days they would have delivered the following week, so I would have had to wait until after New Years for the item since they wouldn't have rescheduled for a Wednesday when the snow cleared). And another plus, they DID refund my credit card. Still... much ado about nothing. It was not worth the aggravation.In the end, I drove into the city (in my front wheel drive, all-weather tire Golf) on the very day the truck refused to come down my driveway and purchased the appliance instead from Lowes. This was on a Monday. Loews delivered the Friday before Christmas.I wouldn't order from Plessers again and would not recommend them. The person in Customer Service I dealt with was very nice and tried to be helpful, but in the end, Plessers failed miserably and I cancelled my order nearly a month after placing it.",2017-12-28T15:51:15.000Z

But, we got a great refrigerator at a great price - the unit was back ordered as Samsung was behind on production of this particular refrigerator.  In the meantime, the Black Friday sale reduced the cost of the unit and Plesser's honored the lower price.  I am recommending all my friends to consider buying their appliances from Plessers via the internet.",2017-12-27T03:25:03.000Z

Delivery,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The delivery arrangements were not good.  We were called by the delivering agent who offered a time and date for delivery which we could not honor.  We arranged that we would call back with an acceptable schedule.  We did that but the delivery was attempted at the unacceptable time anyway.  When the item arrived at the accepted date and time, the agent initially refused to bring the unit into the house unless I'd sign a damage waiver (because we have hardwood floors).  When he saw that I would not do that, he finally agreed to deliver using blankets (which we furnished) to protect the floor.  Then it was discovered that the unit was too large to fit through our openings (although we have a completely normal home with normal openings) and a hassle followed re removing the doors, etc.  Bottom line, however, the item was successfully delivered and the unit seems to be functioning well.  I believe the delivery workers were diligent once we got over the initial hurdles.",2017-12-13T12:22:28.000Z

Just a vague statement about items usually shipping within a few weeks, that's it.  The timeline of actual arrival was fine, just a lack of communication until the delivery was pretty much scheduled.

The Plessers CS team provides a true five star service!!!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The Plessers team provided a five star customer experience in support of my purchase and delivery. Keep in mind that true customer service shines when you really need their assistance and they make the effort as effortless as possible for you the customer. In our case our original glass cooktop was damaged in shipping.  From the moment we contacted Plessers about the situation they took control and expedited a replacement order and provided a new shipper with almost a “white glove service” to ensure our cooktop arrived properly.  Dominique Eckstein in Plessers Customer Service was such a pleasure to work with throughout. Brianna Waszak “picked up the ball” supporting Dominique in assisting us with the scheduled delivery date and time with the local delivery when Dominique took time off. This is the way customer service is supposed to work.  You are in good hands with Plessers!!! We will buy from Plessers again!!,2017-11-25T15:09:50.000Z

Great price and service.  Bumpy (literally) delivery.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"My experience with sales (Barry Dublin) and the customer service team were all terrific.   We bought all new pretty high end appliances for a kitchen renovation.  I live in NC, so buying online saved us about $1K taxes.   However, they had to be shipped a pretty long way.  It takes a long time, so people need to be prepared to order early.   Barry gave me a realistic timeline for receiving my range. As it was a custom color Viking, it took even longer than normal.  I ordered in June and it was mid-September before delivery.  Unfortunately , my dream range was slightly dented and the dishwasher more significantly dented upon delivery.  I was concerned the damage to the dishwasher would impact the seal and cause leaking, so we sent it back but kept the range.  The dishwasher return and re-delivery added another couple of weeks to the completion of our kitchen renovation.  I would not give high marks to the delivery company though I felt that Plesser's handled their end as well as possible.  They offered us some small comp on the range and extended warranty, which we appreciate.  They completely replaced the dishwasher and customer service (Alicia) could not have been more responsive.  I would use them again and our appliances are beautiful in our new kitchen.",2017-10-10T22:01:22.000Z

"Small Business, Big Service",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"It is a common refrain of politicians that small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, but it is incumbent upon consumers to support them more than ever as government practice facilitates mega mergers that create oligopolies which force out these small businesses.  I recently bought a home that required all new appliances.  Without any sacrifice in quality of product, service or bargain, I received exceptional individual attention.  My salesman Joe Jackson was knowledgeable, patient, attentive to my requests and good humored.  I had a wide selection, Joe exhausted every means to give me the best discount, delivery was expedited and installation was efficient.  I am extremely appreciative of the entire experience as personal as it was professional, and would recommend Plesser’s to anyone.",2017-09-29T00:33:13.000Z

Disastrous Delivery Experience!,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I ordered a dishwasher from Plesser's Appliance. When the order was completed, we were told we could schedule a delivery time. However, their delivery company, AM Trucking, called and left a voicemail telling us when they were going to deliver the dishwasher. Since neither one of us was going to be home during that time, we called AM Trucking back to schedule another time. They gave us conflicting information about when they would be available to deliver to our area, stating that they only have Tuesday and Thursday deliveries, but then no-showing a delivery time they gave us on Friday. They also showed up to our house at 7:30am the following Wednesday without notice. It took 3 different attempts, over a 2 week time frame, to actually have the dishwasher delivered at a time that was convenient for us. Because of this debacle, we probably won't be ordering from Plesser's Appliance again.",2017-09-27T17:13:01.000Z

Do NOT let the delivery agent do the install.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"While they are good at sales and have good prices, I was advised to let the delivery company do the install of the dishwasher (for an extra fee). This turned out to be a very big mistake. The installers were very sloppy and unprofessional. They voided my warranty by deliberately putting holes in the sides of my dishwasher in order to ""secure"" it to the cabinets next to it. To make matters even worse, they screwed up on the wiring. It worked for exactly 1 day. I had to call for a repairmen to come out and fix the problem (and wait 4 more days for him to arrive). He found out that the installers did not securely tie down the wiring causing the neutral wire to simply come loose.Bottom line, NEVER let the delivery agent install your major appliance. Get a professional appliance installer instead.",2017-09-22T02:27:34.000Z

Updated (now positive) review of my original (negative) review posted on 8/30/2017,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I posted a very negative review of Plesser's on August 30, 2017, but am now updating my review here and on a few other consumer review websites.While I was unable to resolve the problem I had with the salesperson, I was contacted by Alan Howard (a VP with Plesser's, although I'm not aware if he is one of the owners) almost immediately after posting my review.  He was very helpful, understood the problem and very quickly resolved it by offering me a refund or credit in the full amount I paid for the original unit, along with free delivery, no restocking charge, etc.  Plesser's has since delivered a new Bosch dishwasher to my home.  While my initial experience was negative, I am happy with my experience since Mr. Howard became involved.  I think the key to any issue with Plesser's, or with any appliance or other retailer for that matter, is to find and deal with the person who can make a decision, which is typically not a salesperson, since a salesperson usually just wants a problem to go away.  The internet is probably not always the best avenue to resolve consumer problems, but many companies selling their wares on internet succeed or fail by their internet reputation.  In this case, given the manner in which my problem was ultimately resolved, I am updating my former negative experience and review to reflect the final, positive, outcome.",2017-09-14T18:39:19.000Z

Plesser's were the cheapest vendor we could find, with free delivery and other cost saving items. Initially we had some concerns as we knew nothing about them, they were miles away from us on the east coast, with us living in the Bay area and we were just about to spend a lot of money with them........ Let me tell you that our experience in dealing with them was 1st cabin...... Their sales staff were really helpful and very easy to deal with. They stored our ""stuff"" until we were ready to instal it and the delivery company they used were just great. We just did a repeat spend with them for just one item, an under counter ice-maker. Once again they were the most competitive price-wise and this purchase went the same way as our 1st experience. I have no connections whatsoever with this company, I was not paid to make this review and I can honestly say that I cannot think of any other appliance retailer that I could recommend more strongly than Plessers",2017-08-18T16:15:23.000Z

That was not true for their delivery company (AM TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS) who we used to do the install as well.

When it was finally installed we found where our hardwood floor was scarred from the moving of the unit. In order to get our money back on the installation we had to contact our credit card company and get them involved. Do not use their delivery company for installation.,2017-08-18T12:39:33.000Z

The refrigerator was delivered very …,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The refrigerator was delivered very late. The delivery did not occur until 7/18. AM Trucking was unbelievably unprofessional.  I heard a litany of excuses as to why the delivery could not occur on schedule (truck broke down, installation team unavailable, need a special tool... different day, different excuse). Once the team finally delivered the refrigerator, I was told that they could not install the panels on the front of my refrigerator (though they precharged me for the service they were unable to complete).  Yes, they refused to deliver the refrigerator until I prepaid for installation, delivery, etc. I assume this is because they intended to do a bad job with the installation (the refrigerator door is not set attached at the proper setting). At the end of the day, I have an expensive, high-end (albeit functioning) refrigerator that looks terrible and is improperly installed.  The panels are in my closet. God only knows how much more I will have to pay to have them installed (I am putting it off until my maternity leave in a couple of weeks). This experience was a true hardship in the last month of pregnancy. I never hope to repeat it.",2017-07-31T18:17:26.000Z

Purchase & delivery experience of the Kitchen Aid Down draft cook …,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I bought a Kitchen Aid Down draft cook top KCGD506GSS on July 5th 2017.  My agent was Jennifer O'Brien.  She was excellent, professional and only answered my questions. no sales talk.  Once I made my decision, Jennifer explained in detail the amount of time it would take to ship the unit purchased.  She asked if I needed shipment quick. I did not need shipment quick so it was not an issue.  If you read any complaints regarding Plessers, it is always regarding shipments taking longer than anticipated.  Once it was shipping I was notified and given the tracking number.  I am in Southern California.  It was shipping from Babylon, N Y.  I was notified both via phone and e-mail by an agent 3 days prior to delivery.  The unit was delivered at the scheduled time with no damage.  It took less than 2 weeks from date of shipment.  I installed it with no issues (I am a normal home owner with normal guy skills). I would purchase from Plessers Appliance again if the price is right.",2017-07-28T17:26:08.000Z
Terrible Delivery & Installation,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT USE ORDER FROM PLESSER'S IF YOU INTEND TO HAVE THEM INSTALL ANYTHING. Their sales team is excellent- professional, attentive, and responsive.  However they outsource their delivery and installation to AM Home Delivery who are a nightmare to deal with.  We ordered 3 high-end appliances (Thermador) at the end of May and are still waiting (hopefully early August) to have them properly installed.  We were told that we would be able to schedule delivery and were not even given 24 hours notice.  We paid about $1000- the delivery and installation guys had no idea what they were doing, did not come equipped with the proper tools, damaged the products themselves and the surrounding walls/areas.

I am glad that was the case as the experience I had dealing with Plesser's was simply second to none.One night I placed the order online. The next day I received a call from Cust Service to review the order. I had need to reach out to customer service a couple more times. Their service was quick, polite, and thorough. Follow-up has been amazing!The fridge arrived as described.

Neco rebate nothing but requests for more proof! I keep uploading receipts and keep getting email, requesting updates, no explanations! This was the deciding factor to purchase from plessers! I could have went elsewhere without the hassles i encountered!Do not depend on their rebates if they are processed by NECOupdate: i finally got a notification that rebate is complete and ready for payment. Plessers this is for you!You need to send customers a completed receipt with PAID IN FULL in big bold letters sprawled across the receipt, when a rebate applies to customer purchase! Especially when processed by this NECO company! As far as the purchase and service from Plessers  i was satisfied. I know they have no control over 3rd party businesses, but they need to know what their customers are expecting and what they are getting with their purchases. With these issues in mind I would recommend Plessers. I have updated to 4 stars. minus 1 star for poor 3rd party service.",2017-07-25T14:36:08.000Z

Disappointing experience,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Initial sale went smoothly, delivery timeframe was specified due to occupancy reasons.  Washer was delivered as planned, at the last moment dryer was delayed 'indefinitely'.  Couple days later dryer was suddenly available within a week.  Again, delivery options were discussed due to occupancy reasons.  The website was never updated so I tried daily to obtain a delivery ETA to no avail.  Trucking company would only deliver the one date/timeframe (out of an entire week) that I had indicated would not work from initial contact with delivery company.  I had to raise a good deal of fuss and dissatisfaction before the trucking company would commit to delivery timeframe/window based on my original availability.Very disappointing experience, process.  Next purchase will be with a brick and mortar retailer for sure.  Totally not worth the hassle, frustration and aggravation.",2017-07-21T19:11:36.000Z

Updated Review,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:  Since my original review, Plessers has replaced the washer with a new one.  They also went a step further and are providing us with a 5-year warranty on the product (as opposed to the one-year it comes with) free of charge.  They are also sending us a product that is supposed to help with the shaking.   They asked me to update this review and I am doing so as they did ultimately respond to our complaints.       We purchased a brand new washer and dryer from Plesser's.  Delivered June 14th.   See the video on youtube for our experience.  Type ""brand new washer from Plesser's"" into the search and about seven down, you will see my 47-second video.   Trust Pilot doesn't accept links or videos so you'll have to type it in the search to see it.  We have set them this video of our BRAND NEW washer shaking and clanking and so far they have refused to take it back, saying instead that, according to our ""warranty""  they have several visits to come out and try to fix it.  In my opinion, A BRAND NEW washer shouldn't even need ONE service visit.   A week in and they still have not even scheduled a technician to come and take a look at it.  In fact, we haven't even heard from their ""customer service"" department in two days.   Their customer service person said it might only need to be ""tweaked.""  Really?  A shaking and clanking brand new washer that needs to be ""tweaked"" is not something I want in my house and certainly not what I paid for.  This is truly the worst experience I have ever had in terms of the product they delivered and their customer service.",2017-07-17T13:44:32.000Z

However they will not take anything back unless it is unopened and then a 25% restocking fee. Be Careful!I bought a Summit wine cooler thinking it would be better than on line because if i had any isues I thought it would be better with a local store. The Summit wine cooler is very noisy and when i asked if i could return it they said they would refer me to the manufacturer. They coordinated the sewrvice call but the manufacturer said all wine coolers are somewhat noisy when the compressor goes on. My last one was quiet. This unit is noisier than my refridgerator.

Not good enough. Appalling!,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Edit to update my earlier review following a swift and professional response from Plessers. Bottom line is that Plessers fully addressed my concerns. I want to recognize this here and add that they should be commended for this. Thank you Plessers!The single star is for delivering the dish washer and taking it into the kitchen. I paid for installation and removal of the old machine and the old one was indeed removed. That's one star.I however had to connect the main hine to the electrical outlet. I also had to connect the machine to the water supply which also required me to go the plumbing supplies store to buy the necessary connectors. I also had to fit the machine into the kitchen cabinet space. All of this I paid for PLessers to do. All I got from the 'fitter' were comments that the machine is foreign and ""not like American made machines"" for which ""we don't have the parts"" and ""don't know. how to connect it"". The fitter also said that ""I'm not allowed to connect it to the electrical trial supply"".PLessers sell these machines so it's a bit rich for PLessers to the say that I've caused a problem by ordering the foreign stuff. This dish washer cost the better part of $2000 in all, bought from a self proclaimed seller of luxury high end kitchen products Bottom line? I'll pay for the machine but I want my money back for the rest.",2017-06-09T01:47:23.000Z

Local retailers will claim ""they'll just dump it off in your driveway."" Not true!  -- I opted for inside delivery because they offered a rebate for the extra cost. But even if I hadn't opted for that, given how courteous and helpful the delivery people were, I find it hard to believe they would have just ""dumped it in my driveway"".

I have no problems with Plesser's …,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I have no problems with Plesser's itself.  The sales people were courteous and helpful.  When there was a lower advertised price, they matched it.  However, I purchased a large appliance--a refrigerator that had to be shipped and installed by a third party.  That's where I had difficulty.  It was my understanding that I was paying an additional amount to receive Gold Delivery Service.  For the amount paid, I was expecting delivery, installation, and haul-away as was offered by every other vendor in my shopping around.  I took care to explain how many flights and exactly how many stairs were to be negotiated.  There were no objections or further question.  So I thought we were set.  Upon delivery, the contractor used initially refused to bring the refrigerator any further than my garage.  Only after my insistence and phone call did they consent to bring it into my house and leave it in the living room.  They were late for their other deliveries and left me with my original refrigerator in place.  It was the Memorial Day weekend, so everything had to wait four more days before I could even attempt to hire someone else to come and complete the job.  I was finally able to do so, but had to pay again for installation and delivery as a flat service charge.  Plesser's offered to refund 1/2 the delivery charge for my inconvenience.  I had no choice but to accept.  My only hesitation in recommending Plesser's is to fully understand ahead of time that one needs to arrange for installation and haul-away separately and to negotiate a purchase price for your appliance accordingly.  You can still save money overall if you do so.  But next time, I will go with a local vendor anyway.",2017-06-06T23:08:10.000Z

It was exactly what we were looking for, width, cubic feet...ect. I'm not one who would normally shop online for a large purchase like this but we really wanted this model fridge. I came across Plesser's Appliance and was surprised that not only did they have what I wanted in Stock but was about $200.00 cheaper than everyone else. Fast forward...I received the refrigerator and upon unpacking found damage to one of the doors, because I didn't notice the damage until after the deliver drivers left I really expected to be out of luck here. I contacted Plesser's via Email about the situation and was shocked to receive a reply about an hour later. Joline Monroe handled my problem immediately. She contacted Samsung(maker of the fridge) and ordered a replacement door, had it delivered to my home and also had a certified Samsung tech install it for me. Customer service here was outstanding!

The washing machine was delivered 2 months after I ordered it and the coupon for rebate was no longer valid.  Meanwhile Plessers had the use of my $999 for 2 months and I had no washing machine. Advertising implied that it had a long warranty, but as it turned out that warranty had to be purchased.  The information supplied to me by the salesman caused me to purchase two sets of hoses rather than one. I will never buy from Plessers again.",2017-04-25T19:58:21.000Z

However, we had several problems with the delivery company (amtrucking.com) they contracted with.  I sent that company several emails and never heard back.  I highly recommend Plesser's but make sure you diligently check the product for damage upon arrival, check the yard before the delivery truck leaves, and ask in advance if you need to pay cash for hauling away the old appliance.  We didn't, and then they claimed they didn't have change, so we ended up paying $50 for a $35 haul away fee.  In addition, they left a giant bag of cardboard and styrofoam on our porch, along with remnants of the refrigerator on our lawn, and we found two dents in the side of the fridge after they left.
