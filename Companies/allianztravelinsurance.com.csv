And I filed the claim because I needed to leave town to attend the service. And they’re refusing my refund unless I get the death certificate and send it to them. Which tbh is the last thing on my mind when my dearest grandmother has passed. I wouldn’t recommend Allianz to anyone. I’d definitely use a different insurance company next time. So it’s like I wasted 138$ on the tickets to the race and another 32$ on there insurance. Will not use them again ever. If my mind would’ve been in the right place so would’ve tried to just sell the good tickets for cheaper than what I paid so I’d have something for it. They were no help at Allianz.,2024-05-24T05:16:19.000Z

Terrible insurance.

Many trees down all over the area also. All I asked for was a refund for my $99 fee because that's what I lost to rebook for another day and they wouldn't pay it and said they don't pay insurance on lost accommodations. There were over 100,000 people without electricity in charlotte. It doesn't make sense to offer insurance and then when there is an emergency they won't pay for the fee that you lost.

The bigger vendors win and consumers lose.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We had an unexpected emergency and couldn’t travel to a concert. I tried desperately to unwind our trip to a concert in Newton NJ. I thought I was fortunate to have purchased insurance for this trip. EventTicket took my 2 tickets back, taken out of my control, but didn’t sell my tickets that cost 1/3 the newest ticket price. They were great seats. It seems impossible that they couldn’t sell them, so seems likely never even offered them. I had insurance, so maybe they thought, “why sell then?” Or did they actually sell them and not let me know? This insurance was supposed to protect me from this! The same goes for the hotel. I was taken advantage of by Hotels.com for a Marriott $270 hotel room with no way to reach Marriott or hotels.com to discuss how to be reimbursed or get a credit. I was bounced around the several times I called. I had to write a letter to this insurance (after struggling to find the name) explaining why I needed a refund. I tried to reduce expenses by canceling 10 days before the event. Instead, I’ve been left to stress out the costs I may never retrieve-though I supposedly have insurance. I rented a car through Costco and I got that cleared. I rented a cute motel near Newton NJ and I got that cleared. I got a credit with United to fly another time. All easy and decent resolves. This insurance I got seems like an additional scammed fee. There seems to be no interest in getting me refunded though I prudently paid for cancellation insurance. Nowhere did I read that I had to have fulfilled certain rules to file a claim. The writing I read stated that “if unable to make the event, this insures full refund”",2024-05-22T00:43:31.000Z

Allianz ALWAYS there to help the traveler,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Our family has used Allianz Travel iInsurance for over a decade and have been extremely pleased. The company is efficient handling claims, trustworthy with personal family medical information, and understanding of emergency circumstances. Years ago, there was a terrible flood in NE Pennsylvania while my elderly parents were visiting and both were stranded and hospitalized. Allianz sent out medical personnel to assist them; making complex hospital-to-hospital travel arrangements. My parents were accompanied back on the plane, and transferred safely to their hometown medical facility in Florida. It was just a remarkable rescue and I am very grateful for Allianz. Recently,  a family member going on my cruise in his 40s suffered unexpected cardiac arrest and was hospitalized. He was in need of surgery and could not travel. Our TA sent in a few documents to Allianz.  The claim was settled in a most understanding and professional way. There is no better travel insurance than Allianz!",2024-05-20T23:37:43.000Z

I read the coverage and it really only applies to extremely rare instances, in which case you're better off just saving your money and not purchasing insurance and take the loss if you have something come up, as it won't be covered.

Genuinely how can a concert insurance company cover work but not school? I can't think of a more worthless product. Complete waste of money.Edit: since I can’t reply to the company’s reply to me, I’ll post here. I did reach out to them and tried to get help. I tried to file a claim more than a week before the show and didn’t hear back until the show was about to happen saying the claim was rejected. I wrote their support asking how the hell a final exam wasn’t a good reason to claim insurance for a show if work events were covered, and they basically said “it’s just not covered.” They can post whatever PR response they want but they are not interested in helping unless they legally have no choice.

Do Not Recommend to Anyone,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This company is not transparent with their guidelines. I brought some NBA tickets to a game recently and was guaranteed a full refund if I purchased your insurance. I was unable to attend due to a schedule conflict and when I notified this company they insisted that my reason was not valid enough to warrant a refund of any sort. Then this company gave me the run around from site to site, person to person trying to fill out a form that will help my case. Once I finally did that they said my reasoning was valid enough off of a technicality stating that the family affair that posed to be the scheduling conflict was not really a family affair since the person in question was not biologically related to me. I spoke to managers and even this last tike tried to get the reps person's name on the phone and he refused, only gave me a first name and when I asked for the last name, hung up. This company's lack of professionalism and transparency is unacceptable. I would not recommend you to anyone. I believe you rip people off for money. Things are going to happen in life and I notified you a couple days before the event started as prefered and still to no avail. I also found it somewhat interesting that I recieved my contact AFTER I paid for the insurance which means I basically didn't sign anything, you just drew me up a contract. I lost around $700 to an event I didn't even attend and that's all because I had to purchase your insurance with the understanding that in the even I couldn't attend I would get a full refund. Lastly, overall you have horrible service, I can't even understand your reps sometimes especially when it appears they don't want to provide me services, they start to speak broken English or whatever their version of English that not too comprehensive. I would never recommend this company. I believe it's scamming people. That sort of thing should not go unsolved.",2024-05-18T16:04:48.000Z

So happy to have had insurance,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I went on a 5 week journey to Hawaii, New Zealand, and Australia including a 12 day cruise. We took out this insurance believing our biggest problem might be covid. We never did this before and since the insurance cost is based on the value of your trip, the cost was quite high. We didn't have to worry about covid but within the first 2 weeks of our journey I fell and fractured my elbow in Hawaii and my husband came down with bronchitis on the cruise. Our medical costs were very high, especially having to visit the ships doctor. Although we had to use our credit card for the costs, we were surprised at how easy it was to file a claim when we arrived home. They required a copy of all our receipts which we sent into them because it was easier for me than doing it online. We received our reimbursement within 2 weeks, in time to pay our credit card bill. So happy to have had the insurance.",2024-05-18T04:24:56.000Z

I also requested an amount that was appropriated to recover most items since I requested monetary compensation for used clothes.

I don’t like that I cannot access my claim to do updates with information as it came from the cruise line and AAA. It wasn’t clear that I had to get a form from my husband’s doctor until after I had attached a copy of the doctor’s notes. Everything was done by zoom. Now we have to schedule an in person appointment. The Doctor’s letter should be sufficient. Now we have extra costs on top of what we lost because of having to cancel our cruise. Why are we not allowed to open the entire claim and print it after submission?  Even submissions to the FBI and police allow me access the entire my submittal after submission.

What I really believe could have and should have gone better was what was required for us to provide to them to insure they received the proper information the first time we sent it to help them make their decision.  Instead we went to our doctors three times.  After getting it wrong the first 2 times of information submission, we were finally given a form for the doctor to fill out.  If we were given this form the first time around, we would have been reimbursed a lot quicker and our doctor would have only been bothered once instead of 3 times.  All in all, I did appreciate having the insurance as it was hard enough to miss the trip, it would have been much worse to loose all the money as well.",2024-05-17T02:38:17.000Z

We had to rebook our flight home to a different day and different location as there was an air traffic control strike in Paris. I rebooked with ease as I knew I had purchased the insurance only to find out  you denied my claim saying it wasn't within a 24 hour time period-- which was completely impossible for me to rebook the flight in that 24 hour period. The couple we were traveling with also purchased this insurance and had the exact same scenario we did and you approved theirs and refunded them ?? I am not happy and feel cheated by your company. I called several times to explain and had no luck and provided all the documentation-- you lost a customer!!!,2024-05-15T21:59:11.000Z

The shipboard medical attention we required however, resulted in medical bills that were by no means minor ones ... several thousand dollars for each of us.Fortunately, we found that submitting a claim to Allianz was very easy, and we were reimbursed in full for all of our medical costs.

This satisfied the request from Allianz and my refund was then quickly processed.

We went to the airline counter to register the claim and they didn't want to accept the claim because ""THE WHEELS WEREN'T DAMAGED"" (unbelievable).Two days after I called Allianz and the concierge told me that I don't need the airline's report to fill a claim with Allianz. So I went to the website, attached all the documents (photos, boarding pass) and in a couple of days I received a check in the mail to get my replacement suitcase.",2024-05-15T01:21:59.000Z

Thinking I had insurance coverage for the trip I applied for it and you promptly told me no! So then I asked if I could get reimbursed for my insurance cost since you would not cover me and You did not even reply back to me. This is the last time I buy travel insurance From your company. I should have known better than to purchase insurance from you. You never had any intention of reimbursing me. The medical emergency wasn’t mine, but the person I was visiting, had a medical emergency and that prevented me from visiting. This was the first and last time I will purchase travel insurance from you. You’re just another racket Who takes advantage of people who trusted you.

Don’t bother getting insurance it’s a scam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I paid insurance for tickets to a concert and due to a health emergency with one of the attendees had to cancel. I created a claim and Alliance requested medical documents with the persons name, diagnosis and doctor note. I explained the person didn’t feel comfortable and mentioned it’s a HIPAA violation to provide those documents and they said only if a Doctor sends it. The level of unprofessionalism is insane. They didn’t respect our friends decision and refused to refund any amount of money. The violation of privacy should supersede their “policy”.

First Time Filing a Claim,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"The process to purchase travel insurance and file a claim was simple and expedient.

I’ve never had to use it, fortunately, until our last trip to Portugal occurred. We didn’t have to evacuate (thank goodness) or use medical facilities, but my husband was too ill for us to make one of the full-day tours we had planned. With receipts from the pharmacy, our tour invoice, and emails/texts between the tour company and me, our claim was handled professionally and expediently. I will continue to purchase travel insurance in the future!",2024-05-11T14:26:25.000Z

So now I’m just waiting to find out if I will be losing 400 dollars, your phone reps are completely useless as they do nothing but read what’s already on the website. They don’t allow you to actually speak to the people handling the claim even though they are called “claim examiners” I’ve even spoke with a manager who did nothing to help me.

I put in my claim before the event because things happened my friend was no longer available to attend the event. For only $25 I have to proof so much evidence to why my friend could not attend & use the ticket. It’s ridiculous because that’s the point of having travel insurance to get your refund back incase the person or event does not go through. I have spoken to customer service, always give me the same story that I need to show more proof like what I sent and said was not sufficient. I can just imagine how much trouble it could be for other people that have spent much more to proof why they want their refund back.  The next time I purchase tickets, I will not be getting the travel insurance since it is such a hassle to get YOUR hard earned money back. So bizarre. Really disappointed.

Horrible,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was on hold with customer service for way too long. The employees speak broken English and had no idea how to answer my questions. If they work for a company, they should know about the job. Instead they knew no more than I did. Not to mention you have to jump through hoops and send proof of why you couldnt go on a flight. Your medical physician, records, and medical conditions should be nobodys business but your own, yet they require copies of this information before they approve you for a refund. All that is needed should be proof of purchase of the tickets, and that's it. Absolutely ridiculous. Would never recommend this company or get the insurance again.",2024-05-10T04:23:58.000Z

"Cancelled flight, minimal reimbursement from airline...",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"When Jet Blue randomly cancelled our flight at 2am the night before and rebooked us on a flight over 24 hours later into an airport in a different state than the one we were supposed to fly into, we incurred ALOT of additional unexpected costs to fix it. Jet Blue didn't even reimburse for half of it and so I turned to Allianz and the process was so incredibly easy to file my claim for transportation and accommodations not covered by JB and it was approved in about 24 hours and the money in my account shortly after that. I was shocked! I don't typically buy travel insurance unless we are flying during snow storm season and so I'm really glad I did this time! I will be purchasing for every flight going forward!",2024-05-06T15:43:21.000Z

We had an unexpected, expensive home repair occur prior to the game that still needed additional work so we could not attend. Because the incident didn't take place within the 12 hours prior to the game, our purchased insurance would not cover it. All I requested back was the price of two tickets, total around $177.

Then, on April 8 I received an email telling me last chance to submit my documents. So I called in and on April 10, the agent told me all the documents had been submitted and that my claim would be reviewed within 7-10 business days. However, today, May 2, 15 business days later, still nothing.   So I called in today, May 2, 2024. I spoke with Sebastian who informed me he saw all my documents submitted and he did not know why my claim has not been submitted to a claims advisor.  He said he has ""escalated the situation"" and  his supervisor informs him that my claim will be reviewed within 7 - 10 more business days.  Come on guys!  This isn't good.

Is Allianz Travel Insurance a scam?,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"What is the point of purchasing insurance if you turn down a request for refund when we lost our accommodations in Italy by a private party who offered to put us in his home and then all communication abruptly ended 1 month before travel? We don't know what happened to our friend, if he was injured, killed, became sick as we could no longer reach him. I was told that your insurance was a scam, but I didn't want to accept that. Now I believe that may be the case if you do not refund our tickets via Delta that cost $5000 combined. What good is travel insurance of $600 combined cost if there is not criteria for a private party loss of accommodations? I cannot provide documentation as our friend in Italy can no longer be reached, who had promised to let us stay in his home.

Worst travel insurance ever.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Worst travel insurance ever.I had to cancel two cruises due to an emergency triple bypass surgery. One insurance company refunded me 100% of the cruise fare. I submitted a claim to Allianz for a mere 30% of the second cruise - only $339 - because Royal Caribbean was kind enough to refund 70%. You found some bologna reason to deny the claim. We found out about my surgery on 4/9/24. You claim the condition was discovered 3/20/24 which is when the condition was first diagnosed- but we had no idea emergency surgery would be required at that time. Bottom line is that we had a policy from you guys well before knowing we would not be able to travel. By the way, my other travel insurance company and Royal Caribbean both understood the timeline and were willing to cover the claim and issue a refund. You guys were not. I hope the $339 was worth you losing a customer for life and the lost business from other travelers who we will make sure hear this story.",2024-05-04T04:47:25.000Z

I argued at length, told them I had no idea how I would possibly do such a ridiculous thing, and that I had a print out that clearly stated I had coverage for ""all flights and travelers"".  They still refused to pay.  I have unfortunately bought insurance from them in the past but will NEVER do so in the future.Additionally, when I complained to Delta the person I dealt with told me this was the SECOND time she personally had dealt with a customer that had the same situation.I am so glad this was just delayed luggage and not a situation in which they left me in dire straits on a more serious issue.",2024-05-04T02:15:20.000Z

I AM NOW A BELIEVER IN TRAVEL INSURANCE,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I had a flight that I had to cancel to due to a natural disaster. American Airlines gave me every run around you can think of, eventually saying that I’m out of luck. After going back and forth for about a year (!) I reached out to have Allianz Partners get involved, which I had hoped to avoid because I didn’t think it would be needed given the natural disaster. What do you know, within days, Allianz got me my full refund…no questions asked. There process was smooth, just keep your documentation. They also kept me updated on where my request was in the approval process. I would give 6/5 stars if I could. I used to think travel insurance was unnecessary, but give today’s economy and the rate at which flights are cancelling/changing…you can’t afford not to have it.

As such we had purchased insurance months prior to our event along with purchasing our event tickets. Unfortunately it was pouring down rain the night of our event. I called Alliance which advised we should file a claim and provide documentation of the bad weather like local news reports, proof of ticket purchase, etc. What a waste of time money & energy!! Provided all information requested including multiple TV weather reports for the Los Angeles area which mentioned possible flash floods, only to be denied even partial coverage as it wasn’t a Nation Weather Alert! Keep in mind the Greek Theatre venue is outdoors located in the Hollywood Hills which is known for flash flood events!

Claim paid in full -- annual plan,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Last fall I purchased annual travel insurance for both myself and my partner.  I got the ""All Trips Prime Plan"" from Allianz. This policy covers ALL our travel for 12 months. It was ony the second time I purchased travel insurance.   Sadly, my partner passed away this winter, just two weeks before a planned 2-week trip to South America.It was quite easy for me to file the claim for trip cancellation. I did have a little trouble getting the claim started online, but a quick phone call to Allianz and the agent was able to open the claim for me. From then on, I did everything online.It took me a while to gather all the documents they requested, but I didn't think anything they were asking for was strange or overly intrusive. From the time when I first filed the claim to the time when they made a decision was about 2 months.  Most of that time was me getting the documentation. Once I had all the documents requested, it only took Allianz about 10 days to approve my claim for total reimbursement.I am most impressed with Allianz and will be renewing this policy next fall for sure.  I don't think I've ever written a review for a service before, but I hope this review helps someone who is trying to decide about getting this insurance.",2024-05-03T21:03:09.000Z

0/10 scam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Scam. I understand having predetermined reasons for what’s accepted but there are situations that arise that should be considered as necessary for a refund. Everything doesn’t happen perfectly and this “company” or “insurance” does not take anything but the bottom line into consideration and it’s totally a waste of money. I live 4.5 hours away from the venue and my basement unexpectedly flooded 4 days before the event. Apparently because my basement did not flood within 2 days of the event, I was denied coverage. No further questions, nothing. So it’s obviously not logical for me to leave my home as I’m trying to resolve the issue that takes more than 4 days to fully fix and drive 4.5 hours away but I guess because my home emergency wasn’t that important to them. There are certain cases where it should be reviewed and a decision made based on the full story but just the underlying “coverage options” that are a load of crap. TWO DAYS before the event? So if my home caught on fire 3 days before my event, I’m immediately denied because it didn’t happen 24 hours later? If the answer is no in that case, then you are not being fair when making coverage decisions. Ive seen reviews of people stating they require death certificates to prove someone’s death? Or medical records to prove an illness? Wild!!! They just market themselves as a great option for life’s unexpected events to not make you lose money on event tickets and then they won’t pay. And I don’t need a response back that says “you have x amount of days to review and cancel for a full refund” I could care a less. Buying ticket event insurance should cover life’s unexpected but instead it does nothing but line the pocket of the company offering this insurance OR make you jump through hoops to get a refund. I will never buy this insurance again - a total waste of time. And also I think the marketing of this “insurance” is misleading. How can you state that my home emergency needed to happen within 2 days of the event but I would have had to submit the claim, miss the event and take a gamble that it would be “approved” because it took 10 days for a decision! So really, people have no choice to miss the event due to things out of their control but you don’t even get a claim decision for 10 days after the claim. Think they set it up that way on purpose - bottom line; they don’t care about you, they care about the bottom line: profit as much as you can! SAVE YOUR MONEY - I promise it’s not worth the fee.",2024-05-03T19:06:25.000Z

So easy and Worldwide!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,We were so skeptical about getting car insurance from Allianz BUT since we were traveling to New Zealand we didn't want to get into insurance with our hometown insurance company or assume the credit car insurance would work.

ALLIANZ IS AWFUL - BEWARE!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So far it has been a very poor experience.  I provided the data they requested (tickets, etc.).  They then asked for additional data which I provided.  I received two notes saying they were backlogged and that they will update me when they review the claim.  In the meantime I went on to the system today and it says they are still waiting for information from me. Since it is the same list as the original, I am no longer sure what they even want!Bottom-line, it appears that they try to wear you down so that you go away and that they don't have to pay.  This was a simple $300 claim filed on 4/14.Update - Allianz rejected the claim citing ""A report was not filed with the appropriate local authorities, common carrier, hotel or tour operator within 24-hours of the loss.""As I had explained to them previously, JetBlue does not allow you to put in a claim after 4 hours (you can't make this up!).  By the time I got home from the airport and realized it was broken, it was past 4 hours and they would not allow a claim to be put in.I only wish I could give ALLIANZ ZERO STARS.  They will do everything possible to avoid paying a claim - THEIR INSURANCE IS A COMPLETE WASTE!!!",2024-05-02T18:37:09.000Z

The delay caused great stress, loss of income and an Eclipse day with my family. I asked if this was just for expenses, but was told no, it's separate so I filed a claim. A week later i was told I would be getting $9. And so I emailed back I was confused and was told I'd have to call back. It took me several attempted to talk to anyone who said, no they only pay out for actual expenses. I would never have wasted my time for that amount and this took up time I frankly did not have. A rep should exactly know how their claims work. Disappointing and sour experience.",2024-04-30T13:25:21.000Z

My claim was left as “pending review by one of our claim examiners” until it was conveniently processed and denied AFTER the day of the event I had purchased tickets for. Their reason for denying is that I apparently submitted my request too early and that it was outside their terms which, for the record, were never disclosed at any point during my claim submission. Absolutely scummy behavior by a company that claims to have you covered for ANY reason as stated on their website.Absolutely not recommended.

I recently had an event cancel and when I simply called to request a refund on my insurance since I would not be needing it any more, I got told that since it was 15 days past the day the policy was purchased, I wouldn't get anything. They try to screw you over by saying you can use the policy on a different event but that doesn't really help when you don't have any events in the next 70 days. So even when something is COMPLETELY out of your control, they will 100% screw you over. NEVER PURCHASE INSURANCE FROM THESE PEOPLE",2024-04-29T21:34:55.000Z

Bad service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Good morning, I am reaching out to you because I recently filed a claim a couple weeks ago to receive a refund for my tickets that were purchased around March. I tried to use the reselling option on Ticketmaster but the option is not available. I tried to transfer them but the option isn’t available. On the Ticketmaster app I was told to contact this service as I got the insurance on the tickets and was told since I bought the insurance that it would be easier to get a refund. Frankly I think it is unprofessional that you guys cancelled my claim and will not give me a refund for these tickets. As a working college student who saved up to buy these tickets and was offered an acceptance into a college that is not in the area weeks after purchasing, I was sad that I had to give up such a great experience. Not only have I lost my ability to use the tickets but also lost a great amount of money. This is money that I could use for educational costs as college is very expensive. Any type of refund would be appreciated. I am not begging but simply am confused as to why the insurance was even an option to be purchased for circumstances like this when I wasn’t able to use it in the end. I feel like I wasted my money using this service and I am beyond disappointed with all of this. I won’t be purchasing tickets with this insurance anymore and I would like to be in contact with someone who can grant me any type of refund for my purchases. My tickets order: 22-48293/CH 1Monday, September 23 is the event located in Chicago, Illinois. Tickets were purchased in March 8th. Tickets were $160.11 each and the GA for parking was $36.

PROS,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,PROS: You flinally came through and I got my money. Plus the second agent I spoke to after much language issues started a claim for my medical expenses which I received.CONS: Too much repeat of sending documents that had already been sent. For instance--I did not claim the to Florence plane trip (frquent flyer miles) so I sent the return information but you demanded the whole E ticket. On another request you asked for only the return ticket which require another round of sending documents. Since I am not a technical person all the sending of documents hd to be done by my attorney who I had to pay. We ended up sending documents 4 times. Plus if you are going to deal with American or British tourists you need agents who speak english fluently so there is no language barrier to what is needed.,2024-04-28T17:29:48.000Z

Our plan was to visit our son, his wife, and their two children in Florida. A visit my wife had to an ENT specialist revealed she had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, which can cause excruciating pain when flying, due to barometric changes during the flight. Then we learned that our son and grandson both were sick and we sadly concluded that we should not risk making the trip. At 82 and 78 years respectively, my wife and I have to take caution to prevent illnesses at this stage of our lives. I was very pleased with Allianz Partners USA for realizing we had legitimate reasons for cancelling our flight, thus reimbursing our funds we had paid for the tickets. This was just the reason we had purchased the insurance, and Allianz came through promptly. We are very grateful and glad that we had paid the modest fee for their insurance. It was well worth having. - Sincerely, James V. Heidinger II.",2024-04-28T02:18:05.000Z

I asked to speak with the claim processor who is in charge of my case and was told that she would call and leave a message with her extension number if I was not able to pick up, so that I could call her back.  She left a vague message and no extension number, so I was not able to call her back. When I spoke with the next rep and told him I needed to speak with that person, they said there was no way to get in touch with her. it is an ongoing circle of madness.

Unfair and not worth the money,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My 2 year old got sick and doctors now and days send you home with no medicine so we didn’t take our daughter to the hospital.

Insurance HA!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My flight into Chicago was delayed causing me to miss my scheduled flight which was the last flight out until the next day for my destination. The airline automatically booked me on the next available flight which was 24 hours later. There were other flights to my destination, however I checked at the gates and there were no seats available. The airline was not being helpful and was not telling me what to do. My husband said that they had to book me into a hotel for the night, but when I asked they were very vague about the process. Being a two 1/2 hour drive from home I decided to try my luck at a rental car. The first desk I went to had none available, the second was more than happy to rent one way. I booked my car $198, paid my tolls, and paid for the gas to get home arriving at 2:00am. When I explained what happened to Allianz and submitted my receipts, I was reimbursed a whopping $75, having paid $64 FOR the insurance to begin with. Apparently my time to document was worth $11.",2024-04-26T04:09:15.000Z

What was the point?,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Once my mom went into hospice, and the trip I'd planned since November was cast into doubt, I thought travel insurance would be a good idea. So, I purchased it. As mom's health deteriorated, and as I had to take care of picking up more and more medications for her, the trip's prospects began to look even bleaker. I was over to the house on a near daily basis in the week leading up to the departure. When she continued to get worse, I made the decision to cancel the trip. Had her health steadied, I would have taken it. However, I could not in good faith as the primary contact with nurses, doctors, and pharmacists, go to Europe to a hard-to-reach country. With Allianz denying my claim, I feel I wasted my money purchasing this. What's the point of travel insurance if it is just going to deny any claims made? I will certainly NOT be purchasing this again when this policy expires, and will recommend others not purchase it either. 100% Dissatisfied.",2024-04-24T23:30:31.000Z

I guess it is my fault that I did not read the definition of ""mechanical breakdown"", but honestly it seems like more of an accident to me.  My rental car ran over something sharp - there was no defect in the tire per se.  I didn't purchase the accident insurance from the rental car company because my Allianz policy stated that: ""Your rental car is protected by this plan. You do not need to purchase additional collision/damage insurance at the car rental counter.""  I would assume that damage would include a flat tire. I think your policy should state that front and center in big print: ""DOES NOT COVER FLAT TIRES"".  Anyway, very disappointed and will not purchase again.",2024-04-24T22:14:15.000Z

The people who answered the phone were not well trained or even trained and made me feel that they were doing me a favor by taking my call. Told me what they thought I needed to hear.  The emails are vague and the labels on the website are too.  Trip interruption could be vacation interruption for clarity. Some documents were requested 2-4 times. A phone call from the properly trained people could have expedited everything Took over 13 months to finalized everything. It took my primary insurance 5 weeks. And there was about $600 difference between what I claim and what I received in total from the 2 insurance companies. Some of the exclusions I will never understand. Is there anything lower than 1 star?  Throughout the process additional documents were ask for, was this due to not supplying a check list of requests documents at the start of the process, incompetence of the so called examinations, or just a stalling tactic?

I guess we were supposed to sleep at the air port for a week? They don’t let you do that. Idk what this company expected of us, but it was physically impossible for me to make it to that plane ride. Do not bother wasting money on this insurance company because they’ll just tell you none of your reasons are valid.

Insurance for flights is a scam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I honestly think purchasing insurance for flights is a scam at this point. I am a travel agent and I always recommend it to clients for hotels and other parts of trips, and it's great for that. For flights, hardly anything is covered and the insurance is not worth the cost. My expenses due to a 30+ hour delay ended up being over $1,000 due to cancelled flights and other fees incurred because of a situation outside of my control (an earthquake, a massive snowstorm, and an eclipse all happening in the same 24 hours). I got $150 back which covered what I paid to buy the insurance plus fees that were not reimbursed for parking and checked bags when my flight was cancelled and I had 24 hrs before I could get another flight. It DID NOT cover expenses to get rebooked on another flight as the original airline I booked with was not able to get my to my destination unless I waited 3 DAYS so I had to purchase a flight with a different airline and I still was not able to get to my destination until 30+ hours after my original arrival time.

You Will Have to FIGHT for your claim as well as payment,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"As you know, the insurance industry is in business to try and never pay out. Alliance raises this intention to a new level of art. Summary: I developed escalating back issues months after I bought tickets for various  entertainment events and was unable to attend as planned. I am now am preparing for surgery. It has been a horrible situation and I am in enormous pain. While I submitted clear, legitimate medical claims with Allianz and each was EVENTUALLY approved and paid out, I STILL had to FIGHT for them. I mean I had to really go above advocating for myself EVEN  AS I prepare for surgery- I had to expend countless hours and energy and exhausting phone calls to fight for my claims, and at times EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ""approved"". Yes, even after they were approved, I would ALWAYS EACH AND EVERY TIME have to FIGHT to be paid. The claims would be ""approved"" but that was no guarantee that payment was going to be issued. I would ALWAYS HAVE TO chase the payment and argue the fact that it was approved and why (more than a month later) was it not paid. And EACH TIME I was always ""held off"" with the ""7-10 business days"" bs. EVEN WHEN IT HAD BEEN 21 DAYS in one case. Allianz is the best insurance company around in that they are MASTERS at giving the customer the run around with the intent of wearing them down so the customer gets tired of chasing the payment and just gives up. In that way, Allianz truly lives up the corporate expectation. Bravo. This was NOT a one-time bad experience. this was repeated experience over several claims - all medical. And Allianz found reasons each time to try and wear me down to give up on the hopes of not getting the claims paid out. The stall tactics are CLEARLY TAUGHT. Your employees are masters at giving the run around and making up ""answers"" to questions on the fly. I need to add, there were times where Allianz LIED and tried to make up reasons why the claim should NOT be approved. Each time I had to fight that, and fight hard, and each time I prevailed because I had the truth on my side. I know that sounds over the top, but it is what it is. ALLIANZ IS EXHAUSTING to have to deal with. I had a note from the doctor, I am preparing for surgery, and Allianz would try and gaslight me that I was trying to submit a claim for some other reason other than medical. Allianz employees are clearly trained to be manipulative and dishonest. I will never again use this service. I will always from now on simply resell my tickets if I am unable to attend a planned event. I will NEVER buy ""fake""  ""insurance"" as Allianz does not sell insurance; Allianz sells headaches, deceit and exhaustion.",2024-04-21T00:45:22.000Z

"A lot of work, time, and confusion to submit claims",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"For one trip, I had to do three claims, one for each of three people. The user interface was not very intuitive; it was hard to figure out what was needed. I had to upload the same documents to each of the claims in some cases. Over a period of over two months, I got three sets of emails asking for more documents. In two cases I was asked to provide proof that I had NOT received a refund, which was hard to figure out. Twice my phone calls to ask for clarification were not returned. One of the three claims was closed without any notice or explanation that it had been rejected or why. The different claims apparently went to different representatives. In the last week, the representative did return my phone call, contacted the company that did not make a refund on her own initiative, and did make notes on the other claims. Apparently they now have sent checks, but the checks will take up to 15 days to arrive. The maximum amount was significantly less than the money we lost on the trip.",2024-04-20T17:56:33.000Z

No one helped me,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No one helped me. Too many excuses. I couldn’t get a refund. I bought tickets to go see one of my favorite artists but I purchased them in the wrong place. I live in kansas and I wanted to get the ones in Chicago since my family lives there but i accidentally got tickets in Washington. That is 16 hours away from me. I filed the claim and I put down the reason why I wanted a refund. They started saying that I had to prove the reason why I couldn’t go. How do you expect me to prove that I live 16 hours away? So I called and they told me to wait and I asked the guy on how I could show “proof.” But he said to leave it like that and that everything else was good. I waited 14 days when they told it was 7-10. My claim didnt go through and they told me I couldn’t get a refund. Do better because I paid almost $300 but ofcourse it was my fault too. Never getting allianz again 👎,2024-04-18T23:04:36.000Z

After that ,we requested that it be done via direct deposit,the refund, instead of a check, to avoid any future problems. So they send us the text with the required information for getting it sent to our bank card, we fill that out turn it in and lo and behold ,they send us another check 🤣They completely disregarded our directives, twice.  It makes it worse that when you contact the customer service department ,you can ,number one, not understand a word that comes out of any of their mouths, and number two ,not get a hold of a real person until you've gone through loops too numerous to mention!

Being reassured that I was in good hands gave me the peace of mind to focus on my health and recovery (without the anxiety of additional bills and lack of care). The coverage was exceptional.

Lack of transparency with the claims process,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is the first time I have used any travel insurance.  I thought I was buying insurance such that if life events kept me from traveling, this insurance would allow me to be reimbursed and rebook a ticket.  The amount of documentation required for a claim is overly extensive and appears to the customer that the burden is on them to prove an event happened rather than the insurance company standing by what appeared to be a no questions asked insurance policy on the ticket at the time of purchase.Frankly, the airlines are much more forgiving of reasons why flight plans may need to be changed and therefore based on this experience I am unlikely to use this service again.  I will just work with the airlines as I always have with great success.Overall, I think it would behoove Allianz Partners USA  to be more transparent about the claim process at the time of purchase.",2024-04-11T19:40:00.000Z

Very Poor Reimbursement for Lost Travel Expenses,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This was the worse insurance experience I have ever encountered in my years of travel.

I also filed for expenses after my sickness to be able to get back to the U.S.  I received only about 75% of my expenses because of the way the loss is calculated.  I don't believe this insurance is worth the coverage and would highly recommended obtaining insurance from another carrier.

Based on the customer service reply to my original review, I contacted them to request that they rectify the issue I had described. They quickly revisited my claim and paid out the difference I believed I was owed.  I appreciated the good service. Original review:The website did not allow me to proceed when I selected ""no receipts"" for my travel delay.  Therefore, I submitted receipts for an amount less than the $75 I would have collected otherwise.  It was very unclear and confusing.  I settled for $58 dollars in actual expenses instead of the $75 without receipts.  I did appreciate that the settlement of the $58 was quick.",2024-04-04T17:36:37.000Z

Withheld Funds unnecessarily  (from 12/22),Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You sent me forms.  I eventually filled them out as requested and mailed them a few months later.  You THEN requested more information.  It was information that was certainly not necessary for cancellation of a play for $300.  The information you had in the beginning (in 2023) was definitely sufficient but your company had to play the game and hold out refunding the monies as long as you possibly could.  The other three plays I had cancelled were fine with my cancelling and credited me back right away.  You caused me unnecessary aggravation and I will NEVER use your company again.  There are other more reliable travel companies.,2024-04-04T03:23:55.000Z

Our tour company opened a claim at that time. The hospital and EMS took copies of my passport and said I would be billed. I had the taxi receipt immediately. I received the hospital bills 2 months later and submitted them with the taxi receipt and was promptly reimbursed. Four months after the event, I received a letter from a collection company for the ambulance service with late fees. After several emails to the collection company and the ambulance company stating that no original bills were received, no reduction was offered. The original bill DID arrive after 5 months. I reopened the claim with these details and was reimbursed for the amount I paid to the collection company. Allianz surely helped to turn this unfortunate set of events into a positive experience.",2024-04-03T07:02:37.000Z

Allianz rocks :D !!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I have used Allianz multiple times, mostly for concert and music events :) ! Out of all the many times I have used their services, I have only had to file a claim twice in 5 years. For the most part, I can usually attend my events. However, just to have some peace of mind, I still like to purchase this just in case I get sick, an unexpected event comes up, or I get called into work, and I end up not being able to attend. I purchased Allianz most recently for a Carrie Underwood concert in El Paso, Texas for March 20, 2024. However, I did not have to use Allianz's services for this because I was able to attend the concert :) ! During the two times (in 2021 and 2023) these past 5 years I have had to file a claim for reimbursement because I could not attend my event, Allianz has always been extremely professional and courteous, and really helped me out :)! Thanks a million, Allianz :D !!",2024-04-03T04:44:25.000Z

They are asking for police reports, medical records, diagnosis, if and when an incident or medical reason calls you to have a need to utilize their services.

I called your rep Lagan in 3/21 and he said that I could filed a claim and get a refund for processing difference (I had to rebook with another airline and it was more expensive).  He said I could do that or transfer the policy to the new tickets.  But the policy can’t have any claims.  Well guess what????  Now I have 2 policies and a denied claim.  I called again your useless customer service and they said to submit an appeal but the denial said that discontinued service is not covered.  Useless customer service!  I called to get advice because I couldn’t find the discontinued service and your reps are no help.  Also requested to talk to a supervisor and I was denied to talk to one because they were busy.

Claim Rejected - bed bugs is not included among covered reasons in policy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was unable to attend an event due to my home having bedbugs because who wants to sit next to someone who has bedbugs for 2 hours? Filed a claim for a refund, but was rejected because the ""insurance policy provided Event Cancellation benefits for very specific reasons, and unfortunately, bed bugs is not included among those reasons"". Called customer service to appeal the ruling and get more info behind how they've made their decision and ended the 30min call still without any reasonable explanation. So in total, I've lost hundreds of dollars for the costs of the bedbug treatment, two unused event tickets AND an insurance policy that turned out to be a complete money scam.

Most calls lasted at least an hour with no progress being made. I emailed and no progress. I was told there would be a call back. There was no call. I was told the name of my senior examiner but there was no direct line to contact her. . Finally, after 4 months, I reached a young lady of integrity and she apologized for the horrible service I had received. She said she would personally make sure a response was made. Within 2 days my refund was in my account. I would NEVER recommend Allianz to anyone. I will NEVER get a policy with them again.

We called back in. It was supposedly being resent to the correct address but after a delay again, when we called to inquire about it, turns out the check was sent to a different state with a different city and street address. A call back and supposedly it was corrected again but after receiving no check, we called back and lo and behold, Another check had been sent to the same erroneous out of state address. This last time we finally did get the agent to change the address  and the confirmation email we recently received at least has the correct address. We have not received the check, but expected in the next 7 to 10 business days. All of this means that a roughly $650 claim has taken nine months to resolve.",2024-03-31T15:48:51.000Z

Misleading/False Descriptions of Insurance Coverage,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"First off ALLIANZ is operating a Ponzi scheme with Marriott. Allianz claimed that they offer you protection for your hotel booking, it states during selection that you can “Get back up to 100% of your non-refundable stay cost for a covered trip cancellation or interruption, protection for your belongings, and 24/7 assistance for travel emergencies”. With that being said I booked a non refundable room FOR 3 NIGHTS at SpringHill Suites in Arlington and bought the coverage just in case. Upon arrival the hotel room was covered in dog pee and dog hair all over the floor. I was very uncomfortable and grossed out but being that it was so late at night I said I would until the next morning and check out early… during check out the next morning I was told I cannot be reimbursed for my reservation due to it being pre-booked and the account was pre-charged. The manager said I was to call Marriott and they would refund me. Spoke to Marriott and the told me it couldn’t be refunded but I was to call Allianz and file a claim since I had the protection. I filed a claim with Allianz and was denied because my insurance I paid for did not cover interruptions or trip cancellations, it only covers deaths in the family or sickness experienced during your stay… which is not what it says when your booking. so I basically lost $550 for the room and Insurance… SO DONT BUY THE INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST STEALING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. I have filed cases with the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU for ALIANZ AND MARRIOT due to this handling of this whole situation.",2024-03-28T21:28:37.000Z

I am writing to express my  Severe Dissatisfaction with Allianz Insurance Servicesutmost…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction with the services provided by Allianz Insurance, based on my personal experience.In 2022, my family and I experienced a traumatic event while traveling in Italy; we were victims of theft. Upon contacting Allianz Insurance to file a claim, we encountered significant obstacles. Communication with the company was exceedingly difficult, with lengthy delays in responses and unhelpful instructions for submitting necessary documentation through their website. Despite numerous attempts, we were unable to successfully complete the claims process online due to persistent errors.After two years of persistent follow-ups, we finally received a response from Allianz Insurance requesting further documentation, including receipts for stolen items. We promptly provided these documents, only to be met with an absurd response. Astonishingly, they claimed that our son, who was 16 at the time of the incident, was ineligible for compensation as he was considered an adult by their records. Despite our rebuttal with evidence proving his age at the time, they insisted on denying his claim.Moreover, their offer of compensation was insulting and completely inadequate, considering the extent of our losses. They proposed a mere fraction of the value of the stolen items, failing to acknowledge the emotional distress and financial burden we endured as a result of their incompetence.This entire ordeal has been a harrowing experience, marked by incompetence, negligence, and a complete disregard for customer welfare. It is evident that Allianz Insurance lacks professionalism and integrity in handling claims, rendering them unworthy of trust and patronage.I implore others to heed this warning and refrain from entrusting their insurance needs to Allianz. Our encounter with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, characterized by humiliation and frustration. They are unworthy of handling the valuable assets and well-being of their clients.",2024-03-27T22:15:52.000Z

We were there for seven weeks when we return to the US in the month of September we admitted our expenses for our injuries as time went on until the middle of December 2023. Then they KEPT  asking us for the SAME information  we had submitted  over the last three months. After many Frustrating emails and phone conversations FINALLY  in the middle of March 2024 I have retained a lawyer and within two to three weeks  We were  reimbursed for the money we spent in Ecuador for medical expenses along with $1000 extra as a courtesy for the inconvenience and delay. But of course we had to use that thousand dollars to pay for the lawyer. I must say that this was an insurance company that was affiliated with American Airlines the little box that you check when buying tickets.Would I still get traveling insurance?Of course!but I would do more investigating on travel insurance companies, and be moreprepared for the inconvenience of not being reimbursed in a timely manner.I now understand why hospitals in other countries, do not want to deal with our insurance companies, so you have to pay upfront BATTLE With the companies on your own.",2024-03-26T20:16:25.000Z

"Customer Service needs some work, way below meeting expectations…",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Claims process ok but once the check got lost in the mail getting help from Customer Service was a miserable experience.  I spoke to customer service 3 times with 1st time being 3/4/24 when I knew check had been lost.  I explained USPS Informed Delivery provided picture of mail from Allianz on 3/2/24 to her several times and Savannah got a bit rude and kept telling me I needed to wait another week for the check to arrive...  She did offer to void it and have it reissued which would take at least another 10 business days...  So, I gave the check another week to arrive as she suggested.  It did not arrive.      USPS said it was likely destroyed by their machine when they got in touch as to why it showed up in my USPS Informed Delivery but never arrived that day or days/week later.    I called your customer service back on 3/11/24 was told to wait another 10 days by Aokie and I said that was unacceptable as I already waited longer than that so I  asked for a supervisor (had trouble understanding Aokie's heavy accent as well) and Aokie finally got me to someone, Martha, in the Claims Department.  She had the original check voided and said it could take up to 5 days for bank to confirm check had not been presented by someone.  I asked about Direct Deposit (an option I would have preferred to start with had I known it was an option).  Martha said a link would be sent after bank did their process. I did get the link on 3/14/24 and I entered the info correctly and kept getting this message:  ""We were not able to submit your selected payment method. Please review that all information is completed and try again. If you continue to experience this issue, please call us at 1-800-334-7520, and one of our customer care associates will be happy to help.""  I worked at a bank so I'm good on R/T #'s and account numbers.  Anyway, I called that number and got Guilnerno who I don't think had a clue what I was talking about at first.  He sent another link for me to try and I got same message.  He contacted Claims Department and they said they had my bank info and confirmed last 4 digits.  Well, no direct deposit was done...So I sent a query via your site the evening of 3/18/24 asking about Direct Deposit.  The next day I got an email ""Good News"" that check had been mailed.  I didn't bother to call Customer Service since I had already spent so much time getting very little accomplished talking to your Customer Service Associates unless my getting frustrated and disappointed counts as a win with your company.  Fortunately USPS didn't lose or destroy this check - it arrived yesterday, 3/25/24.  In summary, the people I talked to that are Customer Service Associates basically just read off how many business days to allow for whatever I asked.  I found the whole process painful and I don't plan to buy travel insurance ever again.  I realize USPS dropped the ball on this at first.  But, should it really take 3 weeks, 3 phone calls and a written query for a resolution?",2024-03-26T19:05:42.000Z

Very disappointed in this program,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed in this program. We bought this insurance due to the fact that we were going to bring a mobility impaired family member to the show, and therefore bought 4 tickets in the wheelchair section. He has good days and bad due to several health conditions and the day of the show he didn’t feel that he could sit through it, so him and his wife had to opt out. We tried to find someone last minute to take the tickets, but were unsuccessful. My companion and I attended the show, however the other 2 lost out. I filed a claim on their behalf,  entered it, and was then told we needed physician documents to support it. We have not pursued it as he did not want the hassle of going through a doctor visit to get reimbursed for tickets.  We are upset by this and will not purchase any policy from your company in the future, nor would we give anyone the advice to do that for themselves.  It’s ridiculous to think that you would have to spend money on a doctor visit/ review, to be reimbursed for an unused ticket. You have lost customers with a ridiculous request that was unavoidable.",2024-03-20T21:34:23.000Z

Would not buy or recommend again,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In short, I will never bother purchasing ticket insurance like this again. When you pay for ticket insurance that is about %16 of the cost of the tickets, you would think that simply no longer being interested in attending the event would be a valid reason to get your money back. In this case, my partner and I had become debilitatingly ill early in the year. As a result, we decided we didn't feel safe being in a crowd of 14 thousand people at the event we originally intended to attend. So I said ""okay, that's why I got insurance right?"" And then I'm being asked for medical forms and evidence before the claim can be processed? So I have to be able to prove that I was physically incapacitated enough to prevent myself from attending the event, rather than just showing that my attendance would be a poor health choice? This is a scam and a ripoff. If I got in a car accident or something like that which would result in the types of forms being available that Allianz is requesting, the last thing on my mind would be getting a refund for a pair of event tickets. I would say that it should be made more apparent that the insurance does not actually cover the vast majority of circumstances that would result in someone wanting to no longer attend an event. But I think Allianz knows how hard they're making it for people to successfully get refunds, and that's part of the scam. Shame on Allianz and Ticketmaster for taking people's money in this fashion.",2024-03-20T18:17:11.000Z

Bait & Switch with Deceptive Practices,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The initial quote provided by Allianz for travel insurance coverage encompassed charges for three travelers. However, subsequent inquiry revealed that children below the age of 17 were exempt from such charges. Upon bringing this discrepancy to the attention of the customer service team, we were informed that the policy would be adjusted to exclude charges for the child. Nevertheless, the purchase of the policy resulted in an increase in charge, which was surprising. Despite four attempts to resolve the issue by contacting the customer service team, a language barrier with the international call center prevented resolution. Consequently, we were left with no option but to request a refund.It is imperative for businesses to provide reliable and effective support to their customers, particularly in cases where a language barrier exists, to ensure that they can be assisted promptly and efficiently. From a customer's perspective, such support is critical in instilling confidence in the quality of service provided. We opted for another agency with better reviews and a call center based in the United States. We found that the rate was cheaper with greater benefits, and the customer service provided was satisfactory.",2024-03-11T20:40:46.000Z

Allianz saved me,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I rented a car and for peace of mind bought insurance coverage from Allianz. Unfortunately some one hit my car .. long story short I also bought insurance from the rental company but they told me that the insurance I bought doesn’t cover damage to the car which is unfair because why would i pay for something that doesn’t cover the car in case it gets damaged or stolen. Thank GOD I have the insurance from Allianz and it was so simple to make a claim over the internet without the need to speak to someone or wait on the line. Two weeks later my claim was completed and paid. If you rent a car get your insurance from Allianz and don’t listen to the rental car company trying to sell you something that they don’t honor.

Several times I submitted the same documentation that was required because I kept receiving messages that more documentation was needed with a checklist of the missing documentation instead of requesting different information they kept asking for the same documents I already submitted. I also called several times to get help to understand what else they needed because they should have everything that was requested. I really don't feel that the underwriters were even reading the documentation that was submitted. Again I called several times and basically was told that they were still reviewing the claim and I received emails with the same information.  During this entire process I actually was going to stop submitting any more information because I felt like I was getting the run around because they requested the same information so many times and I was tired of dealing with this. I felt very frustated and I believe the company purposely trys to get you to feel this way so you give up on any claim. Several weeks past and I finally decided to call and check on the claim I spoke with an individual that told me the claim was denied, even though I could see it was still in processing.. He told me the reason behind the deniaI, and that I could appeal and he would send out the paperwork to proceed.

$300 for a travel nightmare.  Thanks a lot!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Easy & fast to give the company money.  Slow and difficult substantuate a claim.  I lost three days of income.  Three flights were canceled in 3 days time, it took 3 days to get from Little Rock to Atlanta to be denied a flight on to Amsterdam because of airplane failure.  The best outcome then put me getting to my destination in Entebbe Saturday night 5 days late which led to cancelation of the entire trip.  You payed $300 that barely covered my hotel bills.  Nothing for food, loss of work, in-country cancellation cost.  Your promise of protection souds good when you want my money; but your fine print policy gives you every out to keep from truly helping someone who had a traveling nightmare as I had.

No personal follow up from claims department.  Horrible customer service after claim filed.et me explain,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Let me explain.  Initially after the incident, There were several follow ups which were good.  After I filed a claim experience was terrible.  No personal communication to client if there are problems just boiler plate forms and ignore. I filed a claim and it was acknowledged as received, but a day later  same form saying some things might be missing.  Called in rep said that's just a form response, don't worry about it.  A month later I get a notice claim closed because no backup received.  I called in and the rep verified indeed I had attached all the information.  He would make sure case was reopened and processed.  Some time later I checked online and still said closed for lack of info.  I called again and agent said not filed under right policy and he worked while I was online to straighten it out.  Said it should process now.  Some time later still in closed status, called again, and agent worked through it with me and assured me this time it was right and would be processed.  I finally was and almost three months after filing the claim It was finally paid.  At no time during all these transactions did I get any personal correspondence specific to my case.  Just a couple of form letters and totally ignored.  Would not even known still showed closed if I hadn't logged it.  Arbitrary actions with no notification to the claimant?  That's terrible.
