Carshield informed provided me all the…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Carshield informed provided me all the items that would be covered. When I filed the claim they gave me a bogus excuse why they were not going to cover the issue. The reason was based off a speculation even though the repair shop told them what the cause was. 1. the told me that I would be able to file a claim on may 10th when I first set up an account with them back in april. (25 days from the pay date). I told me case in on may 13th. rep told the repair shop claim would not start till 15th(lied). When I called back another rep said that was a mistake and my claim started on the 11th.2. Inspector came out confirmed that the issue was internal on 5/21. Then today (5/23), they called and told the repair shop that per their ""assumption"" it looked like it was an outside cause and they denied the claim. so one day is deemed approved and other day it isn't! 3.when I called today, they gave me bogus info that I continued to drive the car while damaged plus all the other crap info that said. That isn't correct because when I first notice the sound, smell and leaking of oil I went to the shop and dropped the car off. How are you going to tell me what I did and didn't do.  4. Carshield finds a way not to cover anything. Why am i paying for a warranty service that don't cover what was told. So that is fraudulent info provide to get my business. I have paid two month and received no assistance. And now they are tell me they wont refund me my money They lied to get my business, repair shop provided them all the info they needed and proof of damage. every person has a different response. One min Im covered, the next im not. **when the repair shop asked them why the feel that this isnt covered, they couldnt give them a direct answer. Its want it felt, how it looks to him. that is not a accurate answer. **",2024-05-23T22:52:19.000Z

We have had carshield for almost 18 months now and tried to file a claim. Our car has been serviced and repaired at the dealership since day one. Unfortunately the manufacturers extended warranty ran out so we had to buy another warranty. The repair that is needed cost less than what we have paid into carshield. Carshield refuses to honor the claim because they want to send our dealership/ service center the cheapest part they can find. Our service center will not do the work with anything less than an OEM part. So we have an issue. We canceled Carshield. They will not refund our money. And we are stuck paying for the repair out of pocket. Had the Carshield sales person been 100% upfront  on the phone about what parts they will pay for, we would have never used Carshield and tried another company.",2024-05-23T12:21:32.000Z

I explained I was considering cancelling coverage for my 2021 Chrysler Pacifica. I completely changed my mind after speaking with him.  He offered me a new deal for both cars but the call disconnected.  I called back but couldn’t get Mr. Brown, instead I was connected to a complete jerk, whose name I did not get.  when I explained the same situation to him, he became short fused and curt in his responses to me and said Mr. Brown shouldn’t have quoted me the prices he quoted me.  I asked for a manager.  In the meantime, our call dropped and the next thing i received was an email from him saying my coverage for the 2021 had been cancelled.  He had a nasty attitude and I didn’t like it one bit,",2024-05-22T13:10:47.000Z

AVOID CarShield at ALL COSTS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"CarShield is a horrible, horrible service. Avoid them at all costs! I have paid almost $7000 over four years to them, and I have had only one claim (before today) that paid approximately $600. Now I need a new air compressor, and my dealer won't take CarShield anymore because CarShield insists on shipping in outside parts, which they cannot use, so I called CarShield on Thursday to find out who takes them in Memphis. CarShield recommended the shop where I took my car Thursday evening, and now CarShield only wants to pay $671 of a $1700 covered claim! CarShield says they won't pay more than this because the shop doesn't take outside parts. CarShield absolutely KNEW THIS before they recommended the shop because this shop does regular business with them. They should NOT have recommended this shop to me since they know they don't take outside parts! If I now take my car somewhere else, then I will have to pay the labor costs for the diagnosis work at the shop where my car is now. This is a deceptive business practice and it is infuriating to have paid this much money and not be covered as promised. I will be leaving multiple bad reviews everywhere possible. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! Also, when I got a representative on the phone, I was cut off and had to start all over again with waiting to get th rough. They should have called me right back. They have my phone number. You are much better off to save the money that you would pay them in premiums and pay yourself every month.

I’ve never missed a payment or was late, so that’s a total of over $7600.  I’ve used them for 3 repairs with a payout of less than $500 total.  Now my car needs repairs that total about $1600.   Now they won’t pay.  Nothing.  I never received a written contract from them when I started this, although they sat one was emailed to me, it wasn’t.  They state that the repairs needed aren’t covered, but would have been by my manufacturer warranty, which I was told that the diamond plan was exactly like.  Even on the car shield website it states this.  Don’t waste your money on this, put back the amount they want to charge you monthly and “when your car breaks down, and it will”, you will have enough money to pay for it and you won’t have to use these people that won’t cover your breakdowns.  In response to Car Shield:  I’ve never had my policy number, I’ve never received a contract.  I’ve just given my name and phone number which I won’t put on here.  If y’all have no control over coverage, what did I pay you for?   I couldn’t get anyone one in management from customer service to return phone call, just “ supervisors” that said they couldn’t do anything about it and no control over what is covered or denied….then why call me?

I finally had to block the May payment and called again to see what the hold up is with the cancelation process. They said they never received a cancelation request but would process the cancelation now. Then stated that they would not refund the payments due to the cancelation process not being followed in a timely manner. I sold the vehicle to my daughter-in-law and suggested that once I cancel the contract, she should get the CarShield coverage and that I would pay the first 6 months for her.

Big Help,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"This is the first auto warranty program that actually paid claims on my behalf.  However, there may be a variance between rate being charged for services and the base pay rate for services received allowed.  So, it makes it difficult to use your preferred providers sometimes.  Also, I find some companies do not want to schedule appointments with individuals use CarShield.  It has been a big help already as I had 3 trips to the shop over the past few months, and I will be getting new breaks soon, which I am solely responsible for of course.",2024-05-16T12:50:16.000Z

Crickets. Complete failure to communicate with us.  Seems like they're blowing us off,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've documented the last 4 conversations with your company, with 4 different reps.  From the beginning, this experience has gone from bad to terrible. The shop I chose received an email promptly after my sons vehicle broke down, that stated an inspector would be coming out to survey the failure of my son's timing chain and related damage to his engine.  I have done everything that Car Shield has asked if me in a very timely manner.  No inspector has reached out to the repair shop. On this past Friday, I was told that Car Shield would reach out to the repair shop and follow up with me on Monday,  and neither the shop / nor I, have been contacted.  Now it is Wednesday.Car Shield is dragging their feet, likely because they don't want to stand by the GOLD WARRANTY that I pay for.  This is absolutely ridiculous. Each of your representatives have told me different things to do, and up until now, I have done them immediately.  To no fault of our own, my sons timing chain failed 8993 miles after we purchased his car, and you aren't standing by your warranty. It has been over TWO WEEKS since his car broke down and we started our claim.  Shame on you Car Shield.  We are supposed to have peace of mind when we decide to purchase a warranty for a used vehicle, and you are offering us ZERO peace of mind right now.Communication and coordination amongst your representatives has been THE WORST.  Get it together and do what's right.   People need their vehicles repaired so they can continue with their lives and responsibilities.

On Tuesday we both were contacted by American Auto Sield, they are the biggest waste of manpower on the planet! Their total job is to delay, postpone , request additional items or information and make your experience as painful as possible. I called them several times and requested to speak to a supervisor, that never happened. The Ram service rep requested that they send a list of needed items and he would get it completed, that never happened. The only reason I gave them a two star( not a 1) is because after countless hours by me and the dealer service representative an adjuster finally authorized the repair. The same adjuster we had spoken to 10 days before!  BEWARE",2024-05-14T19:37:59.000Z

Ripoff,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My car was towed to a shop after I heard a loud pop. The shop told me that the engine blew out a spark plug and now the engine needs threading. I told them I had Carshield and the shop said they have the hardest time getting Carshield to cover repairs. Carshield sent their mechanic and I never heard anything. After contacting Carshield nearly a month later, I was notified that the repair to the engine would not be covered because the spark plug is not covered. The repair shop told them nothing is wrong with the spark plug. The engine caused the spark plug to completely blow out. They still refused to cover it so I cancelled both contracts for my cars",2024-05-14T16:22:10.000Z

TOTAL RIPOFF! BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR LIES!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"TOTAL RIPOFF! THEY WILL PAY FOR THE LITTLE THINGS AND AS SOON AS YOU NEED SOMETHING OVER $2,000 AN ADJUSTER SITTING IN AN OFFICE SOMEWHERE MANY MILES AWAY WILL CLAIM THAT THEY CAN DIAGNOSE YOUR VEHICLE BY LOOKING AT A PICTURE! AND THEN THEY WILL COME UP WITH AN EXCUSE OF WHY IT WAS YOUR FAULT AND THAT YOU DID NOT SERVICE YOUR VEHICLE PROPERLY! AND EVEN IF YOU FILE AN APPEAL AND WIN, THEY WILL JUST COME UP WITH ANOTHER EXCUSE THAT IT'S STILL YOUR FAULT. IN MY CASE, THEY CLAIM THEY SAW SLUDGE IN THE FIRST PICTURE AMD THEN THEY HAD TO ADMIT THAT THERE WAS NO SLUDGE. SO THEN THEY CAME UP WITH ANOTHER EXCUSE AND SAID THEY SAW CARBON BUILD UP. AND THIS OF COURSE WAS NOT TRUE EITHER! HOWEVER YOU CAN ONLY APPEAL ONE TIME AND THEY KNOW THAT. AND YES AFTER YOU LOSE YOUR APPEAL YOU CAN DEMAND arbitration. SO I TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO DEMAND ARBITRATION. AND GUESS WHAT? IN THE FINE PRINT, YES, THE VERY VERY LITTLE FINE PRINT TUCKED AWAY NICE AND NEAT WITHIN THE CONTRACT IT STATES THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE YOUR CASE HEARD IN ARBITRATION YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL TO COLORADO TO THEIR COUNTY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GOING TO REQUIRE THAT A CUSTOMER TRAVEL TO YOUR COUNTY IN COLORADO? I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU THOUGH YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING WHEN YOU PUT THAT IN THERE. BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MY LIFE'S MISSION TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH EVERYONE THAT I COME IN CONTACT WITH IN THIS WORLD. AND IF I CAN SAVE EVEN ONE PERSON FROM FALLING FOR YOUR LIES THEN I WILL BE HAPPY. BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE! WHEN I SAY RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY I MEAN RUN RUN! THIS COMPANY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY EVERY MONTH! BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR YOU TO NEED THEM TO HELP FIX YOUR VEHICLE THEY WILL ONLY FIX THE LITTLE THINGS! THEY HAVE WORDED THEIR CONTRACT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN LITERALLY SIT THERE AND DENY ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAKE AND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY THAT THEY SEE SOMETHING IN A PICTURE THAT REALLY ISN'T THERE AND BLAME IT ON YOU AND SAY YOU DIDN'T SERVICE YOUR VEHICLE. IT'S ALL LIES!I don't need for you to explain the claim process. I know exactly how it works. You sold me the very best Platinum policy and when it came time for you to repair my vehicle you made up a lie and said that I neglected my vehicle maintenance. Which is a TOTAL LIE! I HAVE RELIGIOUSLY SERVICED MY VEHICLE AS PER MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THE ONLY THING A VEHICLE OWNER CAN DO IS SERVICE THEIR VEHICLE AS PER MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND KEEP ALL OF MY FLUID LEVELS TOPPED OFF. AND ANYTIME THE VEHICLE SHOWS ANY SIGN OF DISTRESS OR A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON THEN I STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND HAVE IT TAKEN TO A REPAIR FACILITY. THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN DO. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE DONE. AND YET YOU HAVE SOME PERSON SITTING AT A DESK SOMEWHERE MILES AWAY FROM MY VEHICLE TRYING TO SAY THAT THEY CAN DIAGNOSE MY VEHICLE FROM LOOKING AT A PICTURE! THERE IS NO WAY THAT A COMPLETE STRANGER THAT IS NEVER EVEN LAID EYES ON MY VEHICLE CAN DIAGNOSE MY VEHICLE FROM A PICTURE! YOU WERE PERFECTLY FINE WHEN THE REPAIR WAS FOR A WIRING HARNESS OR FOR A GASKET OR FOR A PUMP BUT THE SECOND THE CLAIM EXCEEDED $2,000 YOU DECIDED TO START MAKING UP LIES. I JUST HOPE THAT I CAN PREVENT ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD FROM FALLING FOR YOUR LIES. WHEN THE LADY CALLED ME UP TO SELL ME THIS POLICY I WAS RELUCTANT. AND I TOLD HER THAT I DID NOT WANT TO BUY HER POLICY BECAUSE YOUR COMPANY HAS SUCH TERRIBLE REVIEWS. SHE TOLD ME THE ONLY REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY IS BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER USUALLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHICH POLICY THEY HAVE. SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ITEMS THEIR POLICY COVERS. SO SHE TOLD ME I WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING TO SELL ME THE PLATINUM POLICY! IT WAS GOING TO COVER EVERYTHING! AND GUESS WHAT EVERYONE? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU.! YOU HAVE NO CONTROL. YOU HAVE NO WAY TO ARGUE WITH THEM. WHAT THEY SAY GOES! AND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS JUST SAY THAT YOU NEGLECTED YOUR VEHICLE! AND THEN THEY DON'T PAY. AND IF YOU JUST GLANCE OVER THE AGREEMENT / POLICY YOU SEE THERE THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO REQUEST ARBITRATION OR DEMAND ARBITRATION. BUT THEN IF YOU KEEP READING IN THE VERY FINE PRINT YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR COUNTY IN THEIR STATE OF COLORADO TO EVEN HAVE AN ARBITRATION. THIS COMPANY IS A TOTAL RIPOFF! ANYONE THAT CONTINUES TO BUY THIS POLICY AFTER READING THIS REVIEW IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FOOL!",2024-05-14T15:32:28.000Z

"If you love yourself, don't use Carshield.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"When you call Carshield you might get hung up on least six times. Between the terrible phone system and the customer service. The reps will not call you back like they're supposed to. Also they will not tell you that they do not cover everything.I took a car in and they only paid $915 out of $2,000 bill. They do not give enough money per hour for dealerships to give u a reasonable balance. They want you to take your car to like a repair shop that gives you used part that will only work for about a year. They have a reputation for giving out used parts. So they're not in the best/new condition. The customer shouldn't pay, more than what is covered when they're paying you a monthly bill; on top of a copay. They don't tell you that they don't cover the taxes, the environmental fees and the shop fees as well as any overages that may occur. because they only pay like $150 an hour and most companies are dealerships or repair shops charge way more than that.. Leaving you the customer with the balance. And they also do not give refunds. Even when you haven't even used the policy but for a month. Don't go to this company if you want real coverage and a great customer service experience! because they don't care about anything but getting your money! I asked for a supervisor and they told me they didn't have anyone in the retention department to help me. Which is Ludacris every department has a boss or supervisor.

I’m losing money not working each day my car is not fixed. 3 days I can take but 2 weeks is unacceptable.,2024-05-11T07:21:26.000Z

Do not get involved with Carshield,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Do not get involved with Carshield! When you 1st call sales they sell you on all the repairs they cover. Ask what they don't cover! That list is much longer. If I had known their BBB reviews were 1.4 and seen the hundreds of tik tok reviews; I would have never purchased a plan! Plus, my neighborhood mechanic and the Dealership Mechanic, both told me horror stories of how Carshield had abandoned the customer by rejecting to pay the claim. My car was towed to the car dealership's servicing Dept. (intake manifold clean-out and fuel pressure system and something else) totaling over $3K. Carshield only approved $400. WHAT A SCAM! What was the point of this coverage? And how they justify their decisions, are clarifying the fine print. Do not get involved!",2024-05-11T05:18:08.000Z

Denied Claim,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My claim got rejected because my car had a branded title, and I hadn't paid the excess fee to Carshield for that. When I bought the vehicle, I specifically inquired about its title, assuming that a clear title meant the car was clean. It was a shock to learn from an American Auto Shield representative that a clear title doesn't guarantee a clean history, and that my car had been in an accident. I questioned why Carshield hadn't checked this before making the contract with me. Their representative admitted they only recently started checking CARFAX reports before agreeing to contracts, implying they wouldn't have checked if not for my situation. The representative tried to deny that my situation prompted this change, but I could sense otherwise. I'm glad my case prompted them to start checking CARFAX reports, but it's unfair that my claim was denied due to something they could have prevented by obtaining the right information before signing the contract.",2024-05-09T19:45:27.000Z

I went to Dobbs to have 2 hub bearings replaced. Gave them my contract number for CarShield and Dobbs asked me would I rather have house bearings with a warranty $500 a piece or dealership bearings @ $300 I said the dealer of course because Dobbs price is outrageous and (before coverage I’ve paid for bearings I know the real cost!) Then they immediately said Carshield wouldn’t pay. So I said for $500 per bearing I wouldn’t pay either are you kidding me! We laughed and he submitted a claim for 4 hub bearings instead of 2 and he charged for house the opposite of what I said!! That claim total $2499!!!After finding out I immediately went back and got my key from them and went to Firestone. Carshield backed me up on this. They took my car in that day and got NEW bearings from AUTOZONE completing my claim for $989. I was done in 4 hours and no complaints. No rental needed.

An email was sent with the invoice at 2pm the time is 4:30pm and I'm still sitting here waiting on my car because they can't release it without full payment.  My question is if these people told you what was wrong with the car and that the car would be complete by today why make them wait for the payment? If you approved the repairs in the morning then the payment should have been processed.  This is something that should be reviewed because this wait time is ridiculous!,2024-05-06T23:30:05.000Z

Broken Shield,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Don't belive the hype that you see on the commercials. It will take something catastrophic to get you vehicle repaired just like you see in the connercials. Itherwise you're still on your own. I cancelled the service tge same day that my automaric was to go through. I checked before calling to see if the bank tranaction had occured and it had not. They said they couldn't cancel the tranaction because it occurred on the due date so I have to pay for a vehicle that I no longer own. Desperate for money, $80. Buy a decent maintenace policy for your vehicle. They act as if they could care less that you aren't happy with their service . The fact that you could be a repeat customer at some time later on doesn't cross their minds. Stay the hell away from CARSHIELD.",2024-05-03T22:13:27.000Z

F u carshield representatives,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was told that they couldn't cover my car at 115000 miles and that I should purchase a plan right away before it hit 115,000! (they did told me that I could pick ANY plan) well it turned out that it was $179.99, when apparently the highest price on the website is $129.99. Also, that I was told that they were going to charge me higher next time I called since I didn't took advantage of the ""first time caller"". Well I called back about for times, and I found it odd that the same representative answered the all of my calls. When I requested to speak with someone new, ""Mike"" ignored my request and told me that he didn't understood my attitude, he continued to give me the price while I requested a new agent, he then told me he wasn't transfering because he was trying to figure out why wasn't I happy in life. I literally had to hang up and call again. When another representative answered she said that I don't get to pick my plan, that she was going to give me a promotion for $129.99 (she confirmed that there's no first time calling discount) since they are the ones with the power of the discount. She pressured me in buying the plan I didn't even wanted. It was a sh[t show, she even told me that they do cover cars with 115,000. What t f are you guys doing?",2024-05-01T05:21:36.000Z

Now I understand why you have so many complaints filed against you with the BBB. How can you approve a claim than tell me that in addition to my $100 deductible I will need to pay an additional $275. The claim isn’t really approved if I have to pay an estimated 40%-45% of the total repair cost. It kind of defeats the purpose of me having a car Sheild contract.

Horrible sales tactics.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,It's not the service that earns this company a 1 star review I work for a dealership we have had multiple people buy carshield contracts that still had close to the full factory warranty the shady tactic of calling or emailing stating your vehicles warranty is about to expire is a dirty trick I leased a truck and this is not an exaggeration less than 2 weeks later I get the call this is carshield your warranty is about to expire now working for a dealership I knew better but I've seen way to many retired people fall for this and opting into a service contract that is not needed when the car warranty still has 50k and 5 years left before it expires.,2024-04-16T20:47:19.000Z

Don’t waste you money on this company.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I had a contract sold to me that the rep stated I would be charged $200 plus tax for any work done that was approved in the contract. My AC compressor failed and Car Shield had the vehicle towed to one of their approved shops. Unfortunately they shaved down the hours of the work to almost half and cut their expense on the parts saying that the shop should have used the after market part from them for less money. They claim it is all determined by the “National Average”.  I expected that they would pay for the work done with the understanding that their approved shop and car shield would compromise on cost meaning I would pay the deductible and tax. My car was tied up for almost a week with the shop manager trying to get them to budge on what Car Shield was stating was a fair price on the work. That didn’t happen. My expected payment was $200 deductible and $160 of tax so $360. Grand total for the work was $2135.75. Car shield only paid $822 leaving me with a balance to pay over $1300. My advice is to stay clear of this company. It is a rip off. I also paid around $115 per month for coverage that wasn’t there. I was sucked in by unethical sales practices. Nothing at all was mentioned that payment was based on the so called national average. So if I dropped that contract and saved $100 per month for unexpected auto repairs there would be no advantage to taking out this type of policy. My advice is to steer clear and don’t think by having Car Shield will be a benefit for you. Between the cost of having the policy and the amount of money they skirt out of will leave you putting out much more than you expected. All efforts to talk to someone were frugal. They didn’t want to budge on anything. No need to have them call me back.i see their mediocre attempt to give a crap about people here. It’s all false. They do not care. The whole experience was a waste of time and money. They made it very clear that they wouldn’t pay an additional dime.,2024-04-15T23:28:40.000Z

My local repair shop didn’t want to deal with a service contract company and neither did our dealership. This is the first service contract I have ever purchased and I’m retired and will probably be a customer of CarShield until I no longer drive. From the moment I talked the dealership into giving CarShield another try, they were impressed with the ease of dealing with them. I ended up paying my deductible and less than a 30 minute difference in the time authorized by CarShield and what the dealership charged to effect the repair. This went so smooth! I had my truck back in a day! Read your contract and read it over a few times. Call your shop and ask them what problems they have had. That way you know what to look for in your contract and can set your expectations accordingly. Thank you for you help!",2024-04-01T00:13:05.000Z

Important to know when using this warranty,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I had to use my warranty shortly after purchase. The first rep I spoke with was very friendly and helpful in the process. They got everything moving very smooth. I felt like this was a good choice for an after market warranty company. The next rep I spoke with was helpful but difficult to hear and understand with a ton of background noise. Even with all this she was able to get me through the process. The tow company was excellent and the driver that showed up was friendly took photos of the cars condition and delivered the car to the dealer with out issue. My biggest complaint probably a 2 part blame is you can use any facility of your choice but I caution that comes with a price. Carshield should take the time to VET where your car is going and let the consumer know that not all facilities will allow their parts shipped in. My biggest complaint came with the next rep who one gave me an incorrect call back number that went to some pharmaceutical company?? and when he explained to me that the dealer would not accept their shipped in part he told me the consumer to call different garages to see who will accept their shipped in parts. Pretty crappy if you ask the consumer to do the leg work. Then was told that if I changed garages I would be on the hook for diagnostic fees at the current facility and the new facility would be diagnosing again so more fees out of pocket. Paying good money for a warranty that still ended up costing me out of pocket more than expected. I caution before getting your vehicle towed somewhere make sure the garage will accept the parts Carshield wants to use. DEALERS WILL NOT TAKE ACCEPT THEM SO EXPECT TO PAY $$$ OUT OF POCKET.,2024-03-29T14:32:36.000Z

Carshield is a scam!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Carshield is just another ""insurance"" scam. After further research and speaking to several people who have had  Carshield, including their own approved repair shop, they have said that Carshield will do anything not to pay a claim. We have experienced this first hand. We have a car with high mileage that is driven daily, so we decided to subscribe to Carshield for extra ""insurance."" When you sign up for car shield, you have a waiting period that states ""YOUR BREAKDOWN COVERAGE begins after either of the following days & mileage combinations have been met: 25 days and 500 miles; OR 40 days and 250 miles from the Contract Effective date.""In November 2023, the low coolant light came on. We added coolant and that solved the issue, temporarily. A week or two later the light came on again. We took it to a mechanic who replaced the water pump and the thermostat. While it was in the shop we decided to go ahead and have it tuned up. They replace the plugs and wires, along with changing the oil and filters as well. After the repairs were complete the repair shop must have, like most shops and or dealerships, cleared the code for the low coolant. We purchased Carshield on January 29th 2024. In March 2024 the car began to feel sluggish after it warmed up. So we contacted Carshield and was told to take the car to a Carshield approved repair facility. The car was dropped off at Mendo Motors in San Antonio, Texas Monday March 4th 2024.We called Mendo Motors on Wednesday March 6th to check on the status of the car. The inspector Kevin, stated they had to drive the car for a day or two as part of the inspection. We called again on Friday March 15th and was told that after the car warmed up it did in fact officially “fail”, it was the transmission. Mendo Motors stated they were working on submitting the claim that day, and that Carshield had 48 hours to process the claim once it is submitted. The inspector Kevin, was off on Monday so we called Mendo Motors on Tuesday March 12th to confirm the claim was filed and see if there was an update. The inspector stated he hadn't heard anything from CarShield but they had until the end of the day Tuesday or possibly Wednesday March 13th. We waited and called CarShield Thursday morning March 14th and was told that the claim wasn't filed until Tuesday March 12th, and that they still had until the end of the day to make a determination. On Friday morning March 15th we called Carshield to follow up on the claim progress since nothing had been sent to me as of yet. Carshield stated they hadn't received all the information from their inspector as of yet so they were escalating the issue to the inspector’s supervisor. We were told we would hear back from them in a few hours. We did not.On Monday March 18th we called Carshield and they stated they were still needing pictures of the car; the odometer, registration, the undercarriage, fluid sample, and a picture of the failure.We contacted Kevin with Mendo Motors and gave him a list of all of the items Carshield were still needing. He stated that these items had already been sent in. We then we called Carshield back once again, and this time they confirmed that everything was in the file, that all they were waiting on was the ""freeze frame"" data.Carshield has denied the claim based on the mechanic clearing the ""low coolant"" code back in November of 2023, four months and five thousand miles before we purchased Carshield. They directly accused us of trying to ""hide something"" by clearing that code.They are dishonest and they are liars. They made up ""hypothetical"" instances, and falsely accused us of deliberately trying to hide something.My attorney is going to address this. Carshield is about to be sued because of this. We have recordings of their rude, unsubstantiated accusations and lies. My attorney will be presenting this in court, and after we win, I will do everything in my power to take it public. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!",2024-03-26T00:40:30.000Z

I just found out that engine powertrain…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I just found out that engine powertrain protection is not really engine powertrain protection. I was just on with one of their claims agents and found out that if the rings fail and are letting oil through. That that repair is not covered. Even though as a result the car is undriveable and at the very least the engine needs to be rebuilt. I personally see that as deceptive! Their agent said it is listed on like page 13 of the contract. RELLY? They know that 90% of the people are not going to read all that legal jargon and they are counting on that. People will pay them in some cases for years and then when they really need their help they can say sorry that is not covered see page WHATEVER of the legal jargon where it states that that is not covered. It is truly sad that they are among the companies out there that scam people this way. Heck Insurance as a whole is this way. With few exceptions.,2024-03-20T22:04:30.000Z

This company is a total rip-off!!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So before I start all those 5 star review you see are fake.This company is a total rip-off they don't do anything that they advertise at all been with them since 2020 never use it 2024 had an issue with my vehicle filed a claim American Auto Shield or American Car Shield whatever they want to call themselves it’s the same company for those who don't know they directed us no told us where we could take our vehicle yes you heard that correctly you cannot pick the place where you would like your vehicle repaired you know why it because 90% of repair shops do not work with them so you will be forced to take your vehicle to one they direct you to out of that 10% that does. We were told that all we would have to cover is our deductible which is $100. Wrong I get a call from American Auto Shield and the Claims lady telling me that the company doesn't called they to let them know how much the repairs will be also the issue wrong with my vehicle is covered in my plan but this is where Car Shield sticks it to you they will only pay what they think the labor should cost they will only pay what they think the part for the repair will cost so now who do you think have to pay that difference on top of the deductible that you have to pay. We have paid around $3360 in premiums $80 a month on time every month since 2020 and they had the nerve to tell me they are only paying $303 of the claim, and we will have cover the additional $360 on top of the $100 for the deductible making that $460 out of our pockets. This is a scam people don't fall for it, I am telling you they are a scam. It’s a shame that celebrities like Ice T support and push this trash to hard working common people.

Terrible experience with cancelling account,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I called to cancelled my account within the 30 days from opening my account with CarShield. I informed the first representative multiple times that I wanted to cancel my account and get a refund. She kept talking to me about what another company was offering me compared to what they offer and the limited liability amount. She then,  offered to give me the employee discount to lower my monthly payment. Initially, I tell her I would pass and still wanted to cancel my account with them. She proceeded to tell me to hold on for my 30 days and compare the offers. I told her to lock that amount in and I would call the other company to compare. I called Carshield's customer service back within a couple of minute. The second representative starts saying that he was trying to say me money when I kept asking to cancel. He then started asking me questions that did not concern him. I continued to ask to cancel my account and get a refund. He then continue talking and asking questions aggressively to the point he started to upset me. I finally, tell him this is horrible customer service and that I would report it and give my opinions with the reviews about the terrible customer service. At this point, he says with an attitude that my account has been cancelled and hung up the phone on me. It should never take this much effort to cancel an account within your given 30 days. If this is what you have to deal with to cancel with them, I can only imagine dealing with them for auto claims.",2024-03-13T14:32:22.000Z

However, now that something is wrong with her clutch in the transmission they won't cover it because of a technicality, the shop says its needs a clutch assembly, and even though contracts states clutch and transmission are covered because it says clutch assembly needs replaced they won't cover, apparently that's not listed among the specific parts.

I bought car shield because they called…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought car shield because they called me when I was searching up the best warranty company. Car shield is garbage. When I purchased my car, I ended up having a catalytic converter problem. However, I knew car shield would not cover the catalytic converter which I had no problem with. I replaced the catalytic converter at a reputable repair shop that deals with car shield. Right after I picked up the car I drove it for 81 miles. The check engine light came back on and it said low, boost turbo. which the turbo is covered under shields service plan. Unfortunately, car shield denied the repairs to the car said they were pre-existing conditions. I supplied them all the documentation proven to them that it was not pre-existing. So they escalated the claim the new claim representative denied it again this time it was because of the Cadillac catalytic converter, which has nothing to do with the claim the auto shop was repairing they were repairing an exhaust leak around the exhaust manifold. I went to cancel my service because I knew of the issues car shield. They would not issue a refund, nor would they let me talk to somebody else. They said this is absolute and that’s it, worst customer service ever. I would never recommend car shield.",2024-03-06T03:27:00.000Z

"Carshield, spend your money on empty promises",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My mom bought me Carshield for my Hyundai Sonata because they advertise they cover all major issues.My car died on me because of a problem with the engine that resulted in excessive oil consumption. For additional information: I use synthetic blend or pure synthetic oil in my car. The last oil change was pure synthetic. I was well within my oil change mileage range.Carshield has denied my claim on the grounds that my car was out of oil, even though an engine issue caused the issue. Sabrina that I spoke to was condescending and patronizing to both me and my mechanic I had on the call with me. She flat-out told us there was nothing we could say to overturn the decision.So my mom wasted over $3,000 over the last 3 years just to get denied due to a technicality.If you’re concerned about your car, I suggest putting away the cash you would have spent with these “people” as an emergency fund instead.Please learn from our experience and run far away.

NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE: Avoid Car Shield at ALL costs,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is the worst c service I have ever had in my entire life. I mean this literally and I am not just being dramatic. I have had crappy services in before but this is by far the worst. I have also never had to write a negative review and this is my first. My car broke down and I called roadside assistance and the car was towed to my dealership as per contract. I was then told not to worry and that it would be smooth and easy between them (Car Shield) and the mechanic. All I had to do was give the mechanic my contract umber which I did.It is almost a month now and nothing had been done yet.They asked for service records and an estimate which were sent and they confirmed they received yet I keep getting messages saying that the documents were not received and I have resent them myself and even had the mechanic resend them multiple times. (Mind you, I was not even supposed to be involved in getting some of these documents; I was supposed to “sit back relax and wait”)Each time I call customer service it is the same crap. They apologize and say they will send the updated notes to an adjuster no, I  keep getting the same messages and calling them to update and getting the same rehearsed answers.I even escalated it up to “escalations” where they had me talk with a different adjuster and in a 3 way call between myself, the mechanic and the adjuster, I then thought it was all settled as it went through escalations and we provided the documentation they needed.Also Unbelievable how they provided the tow service and are still asking me for records of the tow service and other documentation which was sent multiple times. As of now, I would say I have called customer service over 12 times.At this point I am sooo frustrated that I think I will just do the repairs out of pocket and cancel this scam of a service and hopefully find something more reliable in the future. I would give zero stars if I could. WORST service ever.They are good at sales but when it comes time to honor the contract, they are Extremely reluctant to follow through.I thought it would be a couple days or at most a couple weeks but I have been without my car for almost 1 month.RIDICULOUS",2024-03-05T04:34:30.000Z

RUN DO NOT USE THIS WARRANTY COMPANY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"RUN DO NOT USE THIS WARRANTY COMPANY!  We have been waiting 5 days for an adjustor to get their act together. First, the adjustor says to inspect vehicle physically and then does not ever show up to inspect. Second, the adjustor says they need written documentation and then once the repair shop sent it, no response from adjustor. Third, adjustor said they need pictures and the repair shop quickly send all pictures.  Again, the adjustor does not respond and we get told on 3/1/24 that pictures are still needed. Then we call Car Shield and are told the adjustor had the pictures and documentation on 3/1/24 BUT has 48 hours to review the information and approve the claim or request additional information (again).  No rental car can be obtained under this contract until the adjustor approves the claim.  WHY do we pay our premiums on time to get the run around?  Car Shield customer service reps give a long list of excuses from ""cannot see what the adjustor is doing"" to ""the system has been having glitches"" to ""well there is still 4 working day hours left for the adjustor to review the claim and respond"".  This is a HORRIBLE COMPANY - DO NOT USE THEM!

Car Shield is a RIP OFF,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Car Shield is a RIP OFF.  Ice Tea and Vivica Fox need to be ashamed of themselves for their Commercials advertising for Carshield, but of course they don't care how they deceive people, they are actors and are only in it for the MONEY.  I've had my contract with Carshield for 3 years now, and this is the first time that I have needed to use it. I found that The Contract gives very limited information about WHAT IS COVERED but when you have a problem with your car, then VERY DETAILED information of what is NOT COVERED comes to light. After diagnosis of What the problem is, what caused the problem, and what the cost will be to fix it, The Claim still has to go to an Adjuster before it is approved.  No specific time frame on when the Adjuster will adjudicate your claim. You can not get a renter vehicle until the Adjuster approves the claim.  In the mean time, you can either rent a car, out of your own pocket (non-reimbursable), it doesn't matter how long your vehicle has to be with the Dealership.  One day or whatever, in my case 3 wks, before they can even get it diagnosed, you are left without a vehicle.  After the adjuster FINALLY approves the claim, they will set you up in a rental vehicle. You will find that they only pay $40 flat OUT OF THEIR POCKETS for each day of the rental and YOU pay for the taxes on that vehicle and an additional $10 for each day's use of that vehicle. The rental is only approved for 14 days and after you return the vehicle, supposedly, they reimburse the extra $10 dollars you have paid for those 14 days but they do not reimburse the taxes that you have paid for those 14 dys. If you want to go with this company BE VERY AWARE, ASK QUESTIONS ON THE CONTRACT UP FRONT, WHAT IS NOT COVERED. THEY CONVENIENTLY LEAVE THAT PART OUT AND PLEASE, PLEASE,  PLEASE THE FINE PRINT.",2024-03-01T19:27:12.000Z

Bait and Switch warranty.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My experience with this company is that they are misleading, a bait-and-switch plan where you over-promise and under-deliver. Good business is based on trust, and this company is not to be trusted.  It's been a horrible experience filing a claim. They only wanted to cover about 20% of the bill.  What a joke. One company, Car Shield, sells you the policy, and another entity, American Auto Sheild, deals with your claim.  Good luck saving much with these people. When we saw their commercial with one of our favorite actors (Ice-T), we figured they were legit.  All of the people they feature in theirad show customers saving thousands (one woman bragged about using the savings to go on vacation with the $1000 you saved her, and another guy said you saved him over $3600).  It is a complete insult to hear that you would only consider covering so very little ($400 on a $2200 repair bill).The reality is, they are not covering what they boast. They want to put in cheap or used parts.  Using cheap parts is like putting GMOs in our bodies. Not kosher and harmful.I will be canceling the policy. It's a rip-off and not worth the agony and stress.",2024-02-29T19:21:43.000Z

The only problem I had was that Car Shield uses a different labor cost book than the Chevy dealership that I took my car to to be serviced and the book Car Shield uses was very different from the one the dealership uses. Car Shield said the job should take .7 hours and the Chevy dealerships labor book said almost 4 hrs for the same job. Car shield would not negotiate the hours so therefore they did not cover all the cost of the repair which meant I had to come out of pocket more than I expected and that was disappointing yet Car Shield still saved me over $500 on repair cost. I can't complain about the savings but I think they(Car Shield) should be more flexible in situations like this because I was expecting to only have to pay the deductibles for both repairs.,2024-02-27T17:37:40.000Z

Loyal Customer Very Disappointed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've been a loyal customer of Carshield for many years. I've talked 4 family members and 2 coworkers into signing up for the service. Now that I have an issue with my car's front axles, I'm being told that Carshield will only cover approximately 20% of the work that needs to be done to repair them even though drive axles are a part of my contract coverage. This is very disappointing. Now I'm left to figure out a way to get my car serviced, stressing about whether or not they will give out while I'm driving before I can afford to get the repairs done. I'm beyond disappointed and have no choice but to cancel my service. I will use the money I would pay Carshield to set up my own emergency fund for my future car repairs. I will definitely let my family and friends know about the details as to why Carshield won't cover my repairs. I'm a single father who thought getting Carshield would be a benefit but I'm actually out thousands of dollars I've paid over the years only to have my claim approved for 20% of what the dealership says needs to be done, even though those services are a part of my contract.",2024-02-17T18:20:33.000Z

Garbage company,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Garbage company. Kept having to take my car (2015 chevy trax 105k miles) to the mechanic. After forking out over $2,200 for repairs I decided to get CarShield 4 months ago. Great idea right? WRONG. The guy set me up with the gold plan. Now 4 months later car has a major oil leak. So I look up the nearest mechanic on Carshield app. Mr tire, I go in there and they act like they ain't never even heard of Carshield. Carshield won't even cover the diagnostic test, I mean are you kidding me? I got this for emergency situation and all they have done is play duck and hide. So now I've lost my car and my job. The contract probably says they don't cover anything in any situation if anything should arise or some other ""run of words"" bs. Thank God for free public transit which we have in the area I live.

Pleasantly surprised,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"So after signing up for CarShield I was told by my local Ford dealer that they wouldn't accept it as they were too hard to deal with and took too long to pay.  So with a recent small issue I went to my local mechanic.  After they told me what was wrong I mentioned I had CarShield but was told that they wouldn't pay for that repair.  I then called CarShield myself and was told that they would cover that repair and to just have the shop contact them directly.  After letting the shop know that I received a message from CarShield shortly later that they had received the claim and within 15 minutes I received another message that they had approved the claim.  I picked the car up that afternoon and paid my portion.  And it wasn't long after that I received another message from CarShield saying that they had paid the shop as well.  I was actually shocked how easily this was handled, given what I had been previously told my the repair facilities.  Makes me feel much better about my choice to utilize CarShield.  It's certainly not cheap but vehicle repair is so expensive these days.",2024-02-14T18:13:36.000Z

I believe I'm being scammed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed.  Experiencing two separate leaks on my car. Went to an independent shop and the dealer where I bought my vehicle and both laughed at me when I asked if they accepted CarShield. I Called CarShield and they recommended PepBoys. I brought the vehicle to them and they diagnosed them as seepage and not leaks therefore they wouldn't cover the repairs. On top of that I had to pay a $40 Diagnostic fee. I think they are working together.  I have filed a claim with CarShield and await their reply but I believe I've been scammed.Now, trustpilot.com would like more specifics allegedly for CarShield so I will elaborate.As stated to CarShield in my complaint I showed them that they were playing a game of semantics by offering the following definitions of ""SEEPAGE"":A. Seepage is the slow flow of liquid through something - Collins Dictionary.B. The meaning of SEEP is to flow or pass through fine pores or small openings. - Miriam Webster DictionaryC. An occurrence in which a liquid or gas flows or passes slowly through small openings. - Encyclopedia BritannicaD. Seepage is the process of something seeping OR leaking extremely slow. - Vocabulary.comE. A process in which a liquid flows slowly out of a hole or through something. - Cambridge Dictionary.I also looked up synonyms of SEEPAGE and came up with: FLOW, SECRETION, ELIMINATION, EMPTYING, DISCHARGE, DRAINAGE, to name a few.In the CarShield commercial Vivica Fox states something to the effect of ""Take care of your car before small problems become big ones"". So, should I let the effected areas on my vehicle ""SEEP' until I destroy my motor or power steering pump.I also asked them ""Would it bother you if fecal matter was ""SEEPING"" into your food"". Further investigation has revealed that CarShield has many complaints with the Better Business Bureau. I have also found Youtube videos of trusted mechanics warning people of their unethical practices. I have yet to post my experiences on social media until I get CarShields reply. I am awaiting the answer to my denied claim.",2024-02-14T15:01:51.000Z

Maybe it was because of my model of car, but for the price it didn’t appear to be a good value for me. I was able to cancel because I’d had the policy less than 30 days.",2024-02-07T22:43:26.000Z

The company is a rip off,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The company is a rip off, I purchased 2 used cars in 2022, the first car had many issues that were not know at the time of purchase and did not show themselves until way after their non-coverage period.  Needless to say, they weaseled their way out of all but a few dollars of the needed repairs on that one (not wanting to pay the $5000 anticipated repair bill, I sold that one).  Now the second car has an electrical issue that should be covered, but again there is a loophole that exempts it from coverage due to corrosion (apparently, it's in the fine print somewhere).  So, the company has taken probably $3k from me with lots of unfulfilled promises.",2024-02-07T21:13:29.000Z

I’m extremely irritated with the fact that they keep telling me that it’s a user issue and because CarShield is unwilling to cover repairs, I will be requesting a full refund for all months I have payed for, because now I have to cover the repairs myself which will equate to almost $2000. I bought CarShield expecting to be covered for something like this after I was told that I would be by the operator/receptionist that I had talked to.

I recently signed up with CarShield,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently signed up with CarShield. Like many I looked at their reviews and they are very good. However I am a person who believes anyone who services my vehicles should be the one I want to repair it if something goes wrong. I recently needed to scedule an oil change and asked if they a Ford Dealership took CarShield. The answer was NO. I live in a rural area of Alabama and the closest large city is Mobile. To date I have found NO Lincoln dealers that will take CarShield including the 70 plus mile drive to Mobile. Most manufacturers have for years been increasing the electronics placed in cars that only they can diagnose and repair. So having CarShield limit my choices of who should work on my car is dangerous. My vehicle is a 2016 Lincoln MKZ with less than 75,000 miles. The Ford dealership that has serviced it for the last 30 000 has the records of oil changes, repairs and recalls will not take CarShield and they own 1 of the 2 Ford Lincoln Dealers in Mobile Alabama. To add insult to injury I went across the street to the Chevrolet Dealer that CarShield said was an authorized repair facility and they said they don't take CarShield either.I contacted CarShield with my concerns. They stated they would call the dealership and try to bring them back on board. I check with the dealership the next day and the following 3 days and the service manager stated they had not called.",2024-02-06T23:06:46.000Z

I received claim number on Dec 18, 2024 but did not receive the approval till Jan 4th, 2024. Every time I called I was told that it was waiting for the adjuster decision.  In hindsight it looks like the adjuster was trying to find a cheap part. I was told that parts and labor when approved would be 100% covered on a transmission.  Only to find that they dictated the part that they would cover was a cheap part and they would only cover half of the labor rate.  This transmission ended up costing me out of pocket over $2800 as well as over $1800 in rental fees.  Car Shield only paid $2132 for the transmission and $540 for the rental part.",2024-01-31T16:04:43.000Z

Expensive Transmission repair not covered.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I took my vehicle in for a slipping transmission to a ford dealership. They diagnosed the issue and RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT OF CLUTCH AND INTERNAL CLUTCH ACTUATING COMPONENTS, with an estimate of $4185.00. Also, Ford found a collapsed motor mount with an estimate of $244.  The Ford service manager I spoke with initially had the impression that CarShield may be  approving my claim regarding the transmission and motor mount. I also received a call from CarShield indicating my claim was started and he was referring my case to the powertrain department for review. Three days later, I learned from the Ford Service center that CarShield ultimately denied the $4185 transmission claim but would cover the $244 motor mount claim, minus a $100 deductible.     After the initial call from CarShield saying they were reviewing my claim I never heard back from anyone and I finally had to call them to try and learn why my expensive claim was being denied. I was told that per my contract, only internally lubricated parts in my transmission were covered per my contract and that my failed parts were external to the transmission. This seems like a ridiculous technicality due to the fact that my transmission had failed components, period. I’m extremely disappointed that I have been a loyal customer for nearly 4 years and the first time I really need to use my extended warranty I find that the policy I’ve faithfully payed for, does not cover my costly repair. I feel somewhat dejected, duped and ashamed for having paid so long for a policy that did not cover me. I would love to have a refund for all the premiums I’ve been paying, to help me recoup my very expensive repair.",2024-01-28T05:21:43.000Z

I had car shield for 4 years,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had car shield for 4 years.   I've debated with myself  for many months whether I should write this review regarding my experience with this company and today I decided would be THE DAY!!!   I was told that all major parts was covered at $69 monthly.  I drive a 2005 C230 Mercedes with less than 100 000 miles still to this day.  My car is always serviced by the local Mercedes dealership in my city ever since I purchased it in Jan, 2006.  My first problem was a dead battery...of course CarShield denied that after I had been with them for over 2 years.  I contacted them to take my car to the dealer but they were going to charge me over $100 to do this!!  I even had to use a towing company they referred me to that i was going to have to pay to tow my car!!  What happened to free towing and roadside services??  Thank God I remembered that I had AAA...my car was towed without any additional charges.  I looked at my statement and learned that my payments had increased from $69 to $89 and I had never been advised!!  I requested a hard copy of this increase to my monthly remittance and to this day I am still waiting.   Last year, I was told that I have a problem with the pistons, which is related to the engine, and Car Shield denied that, too!!  CARSHIELD IS BOGUS!!!  The payments were set up automatically every month.  I cancelled them and the card they were using.  I am now having the $89 automatically going into my savings account.  In one more month I'll have the amount of money needed  to pay for the repairs myself since I've stopped these robbers!!  Lievica and Lie T must be getting generously compensated for the false TV advertisements that we see on TV.  Just set up your own savings account in the amount CarShield charges you and you'll be surprised how quickly you'll have the money to repair your car without Car Shield!!!  They DEFINITELY robbed me for 4 years 😪 and all they did was played me and took my money!!  I'm a senior citizen on a fixed income, disabled, and was taken advantage of by this lying, untrustworthy company.

I am a current Customer of Car Shield,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I have taken my vehicle to the same Machinic for several years which is Tire Choice, They are very honest and reliable. I just had Struts replaced which is a wear and tear item on my Chrysler Town and Country. My Heater Core and resister component went out which is a major part of the cooling and heating system .   I am told by customer service my contract is 4 yrs old and that major component is not covered under my policy. I asked, why was i not updated or advised I could have had a new contract for more money.   My fix for the heater core and resister is 1100 and im told my old policy does not cover those major components. I have a current Platinum policy which should cover all the major components, which is does not. So when needed the Under writer for Car Shield and Car Shield are just taking money and cover the bare minimum needed for vehicles.  I have had my policy for 4 yrs and paid 90.00 a month which is 1100 a year for What coverage that does not cover all major components in a vehicle.   I feel that Car Shield has left a very bad example of a company just taking money from people and not updating contracts for the existing customer.  Thank you, Bobby Lyons",2024-01-25T21:36:39.000Z

USELESS!,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The package sold to me, the silver package, was based on the mileage of my vehicle at the time, and doesn’t cover the necessities or the possibilities of what could go faulty in a car with miles upon it.  Let me start by saying I’ve never had a repair needed on my vehicle before, other than maintenance for optimal performance.  Needless to say I’ve invested $$$ into this extended warranty that has proven useless.  The repairs will have to be paid out of pocket, and I’m left without a rental to help out until the repairs are completed.  In order for a consumer to get the top tier package, your mileage must be lower than averaged usage. Here’s what I’ve learned from this experience, place the amount you would have paid into the extended warranty monthly, into a savings account.  You will have the repair $$$ as the need arises.",2024-01-24T19:48:42.000Z

Contract Ambiguity,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"For the most part, I received a respectful colloquy. However, every time I call customer service for an inquiry of details to a contract, I would be given a new cost figure regardless of the notes that were supposed to be annotated at the bottom of their contact form for the next person who would be assigned to me to help me. I would have to repeat the entire process, clarify quotes, details, to the new person I was talking with in order to keep figures from ballooning to higher amounts, not good. The last time I spoke with a sales person was not a good experience. He was aggressive and evasive. He did not answer my questions. He avoided answering them. When I was going to charge me a higher amount than that I was previously quoted, he anticipated that I was going to cancel the whole thing and suddenly he gave me a lower quote. He was respectful, but had an abrasive attitude. I did not like him. I hope if in the future I need to use this service that I receive better treatment. If this persists, I will cancel the service. Unbelievable, I had not even had to use this service yet and was being mistreated. We will see how things develop. Right now in my book, CarShield is on probation/thin ice.",2024-01-19T16:13:09.000Z

Total waste of money,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"CarShield was a total waste of money for me. I have a special low emissions engine (BMW N51) and their stupid program doesn’t recognize the difference between my engine and a regular BMW N52 engine, so the only parts they will cover won't work properly in my car. They promise ""100% of Covered Repairs are Paid,"" but then refused to cover the cost for the CORRECT parts for my engine. Because of this, I believe CarShield is a scam. I canceled it after my first claim. I wish I knew this sooner so I didn't waste so much money on the payments.",2024-01-19T01:26:58.000Z

"DON'T USE! Find a mechanic you trust first, then see if they work with warranties",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Opinion: In most cases having a policy with CarShield would be throwing money away, and it would be difficult for me to be more disappointed with them. Experience: When I signed up for the policy, I was told that it could be used at any dealership, however after taking my car into a dealership for repairs the dealer said they didn't work with CarShield. After speaking with two people at CarShield to see what dealerships are in the area, there were a very small number - and none for my car's brand. They worked with about 3 or 4 dealerships in the area in total compared to the area having dozens! It would not make sense to pay dealer repair rates at another brand’s dealership to have someone work on the car who isn't trained on it and isn't using factory parts, to which they agreed. I had been paying for the plan for over 2 years before looking to make a claim and the customer service supervisor at CarShield refused to refund me anything because my plan was month to month instead of their term length contract. Lesson: Find a mechanic you like and ask if they have any warranty providers that they work with. Don't do it the other way around as it is much harder to find a trusted mechanic than a warranty provider.",2024-01-19T00:52:24.000Z

VERY VERY POOR AUTO WARRANTY - SCAM,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"SCAM!! My experience with Car Sheild is beyond horrific. They denied my recent claim which resulted in an unexpected and exorbitant expense of $4,500. My experience with Car Shield has left me disheartened and questioning the integrity of the warranty services provided. I have had Car Shield Warranty for several years with the highest level – Gold package and have never submitted a claim and never missed an on time premium payment.I brought to The Christian Brothers (CB) Automotive Repair shop in Rosenberg, Texas, for necessary repairs to replace the oil pressure sensor and fix the engine ticking noise, which lead to removal of the engine heads, as recommended by the professional assessment. To my dismay, Car Shield chose to deny the claim, leaving me burdened with half of the financial responsibility for the repairs. What perplexes me is the incongruity between the repair shop's recommendation and their denial. I expected my warranty coverage to provide support in instances precisely like this, where crucial engine components required attention. The lack of approval without a comprehensible explanation is not only disconcerting but also leaves me questioning the reliability of the coverage I have diligently paid for.The approach to repairing the mechanical problems was attempting the least expensive first.  Fixing the parts under the valve cover did not resolve the problem so the next step was to remove the heads where two (2) valves were defective and replaced with resolved the problem.It seems American Auto Shield workers are trained to say, “The owner operator should not have driven the vehicle so long under these conditions”. The Car Rental Service during repair claim process was SO POOR. They tried the cheapest fix first and it wasn’t the source of the problem. So I had to go back and they went into the core of the engine. They fixed the problem (finally) and this part was not covered by my Car Shield warranty. I contacted Carshield and American Auto Shield customer support several times requesting to speak to management only to be told they will put in the request and 24 to 48 hours a representative will contact me about this matter.  Stay far away from Car Shield and do not waste your time and money – IT’S A SCAM.",2024-01-16T16:08:45.000Z

misleading contracts,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’m writing this complaint as a result of Car Shield violating my contract and agreement. I purchased a warranty for my 2018 BMW M3 on September 8, 2022 and submitted the first claim in sept 2023 (still open).  The Sales Representative misrepresented the contracts (all calls are recorded). I purchased the warranty under certain precepts that my car would be covered for things initially discussed which they agreed to covering. I made my first claim in sept 2023 for a transmission-related problem which they said multiple times in a recorded phone conversation would be covered. According to the contracts, ""internally lubricated parts are covered."" Car Shield USA denied my claim, asserting that the specific part was not internally lubricated.At Car Shields direction, in an effort to get the claim approved, we (mechanic and I) gathered many items to support the claim. At Car Shields request, which they said if we can produce they will approve the claim, I submitted forums/diagrams/live videos, and documents sourced from BMW Corporate direction confirming the internal lubrication. This means it meets the disposition of the contract by definition. Once producing the requested documents, Car Shield USA denied the submissions and requested more proof.Car Shield agreed initially simply having photos/videos submit, we offered to have a neutral 3rd party present to inspect for additional support. The adjuster, Tyler, led me down this road of chasing documents for months. As a result, the car has sat unable to being driven due to the first claim, and now additional mechanical issues have come up. This is an additional issue as a direct result of Car Shields unethical and unlawful breach of contract leading to the car to sit. Car Shield USA abruptly reversed its position in light of these additional issues, claiming that the issue would not be covered under any circumstances even with proof.I have made an effort to resolve this issue with Car Shields directly and it is clear at this point they show no intention of directly resolving any of these issues. IN addition, Car Shield will not supply of list of direct items covered/not covered showing further misrepresentation. I’m formally requesting these claims be approved as previously discussed or a full refund of my contract purchase price as they are in breach of contract and misrepresented the terms and conditions of the contract prior to commencement",2024-01-15T18:37:38.000Z

First rep told me they couldn't help because I only had 2 months with carshield? Then I talked to this lady and she said I had to have carshield for at least 200 and something days. So I went to cancel the service being they can't help me with my car. When I spoke to the lady to cancel my service she said of course we can help you. I was so confused why the other people told me they couldn't and so was she. I was so relieved to finally speak to someone who knows what they're talking about.

Do NOT purchase CarShield Warranty!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I researched a few different extended warranty companies and decided to go with CarShield. I bought their top of the line warranty coverage for my 2018 Ram Rebel for $99/month. After 5 months, my truck needed replacement of both exhaust manifolds and a CV axle. I brought my truck to a RAM dealership and they submitted the claims. Guess what? CarShield declined the exhaust manifolds despite me having called them 2 days prior to be sure it was covered which they stated it was. They agreed to the CV axle but only for an aftermarket non OEM part. Th RAM dealership informed me that they have dealt with CarShield multiple times and said they rarely pay for any claims and it takes them several weeks/months to receive any payment from CarShield. Meanwhile, this RAM dealership will not release my truck back to me until the claim is paid. Do NOT purchase a CarShield warranty!!! They will find any excuse to deny your claims.Please read these reviews. You will notice the 5-stars are from the SAME person repeatedly. You can tell by the words/language used that the reviews are FAKE! I’m a well-educated man and I still got screwed over by CarShield and now I need to waste time by hiring an attorney to file a lawsuit against them.Sincerely,Brian R. Stephenson MSN APRN FNP-C***UPDATE 1/12/24***After spending 8 long grueling days dealing with CarShield/American Auto Shield, they finally approved my claim for the exhaust manifold issue. ***Wait for it*** They agreed to cover the manifold gaskets and bolts but DECLINED the extraction of the broken bolts that are in the aluminum head ! I can't make this stuff up people! The dealership quoted them $1500, but this horrible car warranty company only approved $700. I literally spent hours on the phone with this fraudulent car warranty company dealing with people from the Philippines that I couldn't understand and each one I spoke with wanted me to tell them what email and exact time the car dealership sent them the estimate.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.........If you currently have them, please cancel because when you actually need services that you have paid for for many months or years, they will NOT cover you!!!!

"Car Shield use their ""Policy Terms"" to not pay for repair.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My wifes cars engine light came on when she was only a mile or so from home. she drove it the rest of the way home because the car was still driving fine, not smoking or anything serious to make her stop AND MOST IMPORTANT she was 8.5 months PREGNANT. The whole reason we got the warranty in the first place was for her to be safe.  So I called to make the claim and being honest, I told them she drove it home the one mile and it was in front of the house because to me it was no big deal and what any logical person would do.  DONT TELL THEM YOU DROVE IT HOME AND DO NOT DRIVE IT IF THE LIGHT GOES ON.  Turns out the timing had a catastrophic failure and i was told it needed a new engine. They would not cover it because we ""drove"" it a mile home.  They paid only 3k instead of the 9k required for a new engine that the car repair place said it needed as well as the inspector they sent out.  Every time i asked why they always said ""they were doing me a favor"" and paying for what caused the problem (timing failure). GET OUTTA HERE. I heard that several times which sounded pretty scripted, like this is their way to get out of paying for large repairs. So we are left high and dry.  Even on their policy it says pull over to a safe location.  A 4 lane highway where i live is not safe to pull over when people drive crazy and 60 plus mph especially 8.5 months pregnant!!  You know what the final person told me when I got the you drove it a mile answer…..Well every road has to have a place to pull over so you should have done that!!  THAT IS NOT SAFE!!  How often do you hear someone got killed being pulled over on the side of the road because someone was texting and driving.  Then when you try to fight it, they denied it instantly and then no one would talk to me or answer my questions as to why. Even the mechanic shop said they have never dealt with such a poor insurance company as this.  They wouldnt talk to him either when he was also trying to understand their reasoning.  Also, during the time we tried to get a reason and fight this, which ended up being a month and a half of no car, we had to keep paying for a warranty to sit at a repair shop!!  And what if my wife had to take the baby to hospital for some reason while I was at work?  The car warranty things you hear....yea they are true.  Go elsewhere.",2024-01-12T01:15:43.000Z

It seems like employees work from home and there is no internal comunication. Then after months of playing us arounf they denied the claim, and according to the contract the parts are covered.  Furthermore, the customer service is shameful.The representatives are disdainful, keep yawning over the phone, yell, talk over you and are simply plain rude, not to mention they have a racist behaviour. I requested to speak to a supervisor 4 times and the responses were: we do not have supervisors; the supervisors are here to help the agent not you; I am not handing over to a supervisor if you want you can call back; there are no supervisors available.

Now I’m responsible for a good chunk of the labor, now somewhere around 600.00. It really doesn’t matter because they were adamant on saying that they only have a different scale on labor than the repair shop. I thought all repair shops followed the same labor guide. Nobody looks at these reviews anyway. I would say, if you are looking for a warranty company, ask a lot of questions. They pay for parts but not all the labor.

Ehhh is all i can say,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Ehhh is all i can say, ive been paying for “diamond” coverage for 22 months at $99.00 a month. About 17 days ago was the 1st time i was able to actually make a claim since my shifter dial went out. Unfortunately it was 2 days before Christmas where everything was either closed or booked up. Thankfully i had a good connect with a mechanic and they were able to tow the vehicle away so it was off the road, but due to the holidays they wouldnt be able to get to it till a much later date, almost 10 days after the incident (due to new years and prior work already being booked) This seemed to be the case anywhere i turned unfortunately. So i decided to suck it up, leave my car, and get a rental since not only did i have a drive planned to see family but also a ski trip planned not too far away. Couple of hours drive. The rental ended up costing me about $400 which under the contract was over the $40 a day limit up to $280, which is fine, i was aware of this. But what ticked me off was that they required “4 labor hours” in order for me to qualify for a rental. Mind you, ive been out of a vehicle for SIXTEEN DAYS… when i explained the situation to the adjuster they scoffed and laughed at me, saying they couldn't help. Honestly I felt pretty robbed. I plan on discontinuing my coverage due to this experience, just not really worth it in my opinion, I would have saved $1700 by paying this out of pocket instead of paying for a extended warranty. I would have also saved myself a headache because thats exactly what i got when dealing with this company. Genuinely dissatisfied and even a little pissed off, hope this helps!",2024-01-05T18:35:43.000Z

Thinking it would at least last me to the end of my days. I also got carshield since they have the best people on their commercials that I trust. So I have had carshield over a year now and my head gasket blew while driving the other day and in turn blew the engine the carshield company only wanted to pay for the gasket but everyone knows the faulty head gasket caused the whole engine to blow it threw rods because of the faulty head gasket. So they are worthless just like everything else. They don't help u out they make your life worse. Don't get carshield they won't pay for much just bare minimum. Right now I have to pay the auto company that has my vehicle 500 dollars for a motor tare down so I gotta come up with that before I can even get my car back. What now? Oh the auto company wants 9400 dollars to put in a rebuilt engine in my 09 jeep and that is what I paid for the vehicle only a year ago!,2024-01-04T18:09:21.000Z

I live in Alaska, I have 1 vehicle and it's winter.  I lost my right front drive on my 4 wheel drive dodge ram p.u. and it took out everything including bearings and rotor, cv joint assembly.  I had the car towed to my garage of choice, which was certified per car shield standards.  the garage went to work and picked up the repair parts at the local auto zone and I was back on the road a day later. then began the nightmare. the bill was submitted to car shield and immediately they denied a portion of the cost of the repair parts because they could have supplied them cheaper by mailing them to Alaska which could have taken weeks. they denied a portion of the labor charges, because the cost exceeded what was in their lower 48 lower labor cost book.  they only approved 700 dollars of my 1400$ repair bill.  and to top it off they only approved 125 dollars of 140 dollar tow bill.  that's their max.  I'm glad I only live 15 miles from the garage.  I've broken down before 100 miles from home during the winter in another vehicle and the tow bill was 700$.  I recommend you skip car shield and set aside what they would charge you for coverage in a separate account each month and be your own insurance.  they offer no value unless you enjoy getting the shaft with bad service and poor policy that doesn't match their advertising!  it's a scam!",2024-01-04T05:44:15.000Z

Then they said they would reimburse me if the claim went through. Well it did and now they are only going to reimburse for one day because it was a 9 hour job. I didn't have a car for 4 weeks because they took their time to go and look at it to see if claim was valid. Then was suppose to get a new transmission and they didn't pay for a new one.

I have paid in over $4,000+ to have my car covered just in case that it needed a repair as it is an older vehicle they would cover more parts compared to a newer vehicle that probably has a warranty anyway. Now with that being Said I needed work done on my vehicle after all is a 2000. After paying 4 years all they could cover was a water pump for $600 hundred dollars! Really! They wouldn't work on the transmission even though they said it was covered, but since mine is electronic they will not work on it. Are you kidding me! My policy did not even cover new brake hoses! which is total crap! After I was transferred from car shield to auto America and the gentleman on the phone told me they could only cover the water pump. I was so shocked and let down I canceled my membership right away. Eh, I just got jipped out of $4000+. The commercials you see on TV may be so enticing, But I highly recommend that you do not get any policy with.

They will never pay for your repairs,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The commercial and advertising are all false.  We have been with CarShield for 5+ years, making our payments on time and keeping our car regularly maintained at the dealership.  We had a problem with the throttle body a couple of years ago and we were denied the claim because in the fine print, throttle bodies aren't covered.  This past month, when we took the car in for service they said that the car was burning oil and needed to do a teardown  to figure out the problem.  We reported this to CarShield, they approved the teardown and authorized us to get a rental vehicle.  The dealership did the teardown and realized that a new engine would be needed, but had to wait three weeks to get an inspection from CarShield.  They finally came and did the inspection and sent my wife a text saying that the repairs are approved.  Great!  Until the following day when they called to say that the repairs were not approved AND since they weren't, we had to pay for the rental car...after a 3 week delay on their part!Basically, in our experience, every word in their commercials and ads and on the website are untrue.  We paid over $5,000 in premiums for absolutely nothing but disappointment in return.  We have canceled this bogus service and recommend that everyone else do the same.  No matter the issue with your car, they have some unseen little loophole to get out of paying for it like they say.  This is not an extended warranty, this is a scam.  The only response they had to our questions is  ""you didn't read the fine print.""  If we saw everything in the fine print, we never would have paid a nickel to this company, because nothing is covered.",2023-12-29T18:03:31.000Z

Absolutely would never buy it,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely would never buy it! I had it for almost 3 years when my A/C went out. 2013 RAM, it was like pulling teeth to find a dealership that was willing to deal with CarShield plans. They told me repeatedly that they were the worst plan warranty to deal with and would not take the coverage. CarShield also requires highly detailed and verifiable scheduled maintenance records for 1st 2years which I was exempted from but none the less was unable to get them to pay all but the deductible I was responsible for after endless delaying tactics from requiring photos of the suspect broken components, how do you do this without first (and I had to pay for this “ DIAGNOSTIC VERIFICATION “ with photos….They would not pay for OEM parts that I wanted to be used on my vehicle which I thought was reasonable but NOT covered. I would have to pay for these items ie, evaporator, compressor and drier…. Well that doesn’t leave much for them… bottom line STAY AWAY FROM CARSHIELD!!!! Save your money by putting it in an account instead of paying them for services you are NOT going to get. More: Employed misleading sales and advertising practices, including TV advertisements stating consumers will not be responsible for expensive repairs and can take their vehicle to any repair facility which consumers found was not to be trueFailed to cover repairsFailed to adequately explain mileage and time component before coverage beginsDid not cancel their policies and provide refundsDelayed taking and processing claims leaving customers without their vehiclesUnable to find an authorized repair shopProvided poor customer serviceIt states plainly in all their commercials and in the plan documents that the entirety of A/C system is covered. This is a lie and misleading in their commercials. I’ll not own another policy from CarShield EVER!!!I will provide my invoice to anyone who is interested in reviewing my nightmare experience.",2023-12-22T02:45:36.000Z

This company is a joke. Get a dealership warranty instead!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Had an sensor issue which is covered with my “diamond” membership (roughly 100 a month.) my mechanic is a close family friend took the truck over to him for diagnostics and called carsheild with the results from the testing. While on the phone with my mechanic they told him he didn’t perform enough diagnostics on the vehicle and argued with him about what he’s been doing for over 40 years then hung up on him after getting into the argument with him. After I called back again they put through the claim and told me that his 6 hour labor cost for changing the sensor (which was buried towards the bottom of the engine and needed parts to be removed to get to) was to high and they would only over 2.5 hours. Total cost of job was about 1000 after this they also told him the cost of the 28 dollar sensor (which he had a receipt for) was only being reimbursed for 20 dollars. In total I’m stuck paying roughly $700. This is after months of making payments and when signing up being told they will cover whatever needed to be covered when it came to engine issues under the policy I have. This company is a waste of money and unnecessary stress. Do yourself a favor and try to get an extended warranty off of your dealership before dealing this this money pit of a company. Unless you want to deal with unprofessional “specialists” who sit at a desk and try to tell experienced mechanics how to do their jobs.,2023-12-21T18:45:12.000Z

Carshield is an Insurance scam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was a Carshield member for over 3 months when the check engine light came on.  I took my car to the dealer  and submitted a claim.  After more than a week, I contacted Carshield and they asked for the dealer to perform a detailed inspection which they did.   Another week and a half went by so I called again.  Carshield requested pictures of the vehicle from all four sides. I complied.  After another two weeks Carshield asked for a year's worth of maintenance records.   Again I complied.   After another week I called and Carshield said they would not pay the claim because my maintenance records indicated that the oil level was low on three reports. The oil light had never come on at any time during the year.  Long story short, Carshield dragged out my claim for 2 months and left me with a bill for $2200.  They kept stalling until they could find a reason to deny my claim.  My Carshield contract did not mention any requirement for submission of maintenance records.

The most helpful people one could ever dream of until you have the slightest thing go wrong.. First off CarShield coverage states “will cover towing”. My car broke down less than 30 miles from my house and they wouldn’t cover but $75 for towing which NEVER happened. My towing bill was $589 and not seen a penny from them.  Now I’m supposed to dish out another $2,000 to the mechanic (non reimbursable) “to determine if it’s a covered part”.  Save your money for parts and mechanic. You’ll be well ahead instead of giving these scam artists a monthly allowance that’ll never pay off. WORST mistake one could make.",2023-12-20T04:15:25.000Z

My car's motor started slipping and the first thing I did was take it to my mechanic. The mechanic said I need another motor and I thought I was ok because I had CarShield...WRONG. They gave me the run around for weeks and then finally said they would do an investigation. That investigation was FRAUDULENT. The report stated that I had no oil in my car and I know that wasn't true because it was at my mechanic's shop and he told me there was oil in there at the time of the investigation. I told them what my mechanic said and I gave them all the receipts for my oil regular changes. They still stood by the FALSE report and refused to pay for my car repair. I would not recommend them to anyone and I will make sure to discourage everyone from using them. I don't understand why they haven't been shut down yet. They have over 2000 negative reviews on the BBB website. It's outrageous that they continue to take advantage of people like this.,2023-12-14T23:30:36.000Z

Lhughes experience,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I would give a five star, but I was disappointed when the Car Shield tech told me if the certified vendor, that you guys sent me too, did not only submit paperwork to start the claim, but also needed to call and be transferred to an adjuster or it could take as much as 48 hours to get the ball rolling on fixing my car.  I was furious because that was not how it was explained to me.  I feel there is a huge disconnect in your organization when the push is to have things submitted online only to find out that it will take as much as twenty four to fourty eight hours longer to get the claim rolling.  I don’t have s second vehicle as I sold my husband’s truck upon his untimely death.  I thought y’all would take care of me, but now I am beginning to wonder.I hope the person reading this has an extraordinary Christmas and glorious New Year.

This is a terrible company!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is a terrible company!!! I should've canceled my warranty with Carshield when I seen a sign outside dealership bodyshop stating, “we do not accept car shield” then two different dealer body shops told me Carshield doesn't like to pay and they ripped their customers off. If I could, I would rate Carshield negative stars. I've been lied to and mislead They false advertise their company. When it comes to covering parts, they only pay a portion or not at all even though your contract reads that the part is covered. So, if a part cost $1000 Carshield may pay $300 of that so they choose how much money they want to pay when a claim is initiated. I've been out of a vehicle for 6 days. I don't qualify for a rental because the labor for a radiator is less than 4 hours. I still don't qualify even when they said I would of the part delivery was a delay. Not to mention, carshield would not cover the other issues my truck is having. I have the platinum and gold coverage on my vehicle (2 plans) and I still paid $1,100 out of pocket and carshield paid $150. I will never recommend this company to anyone.",2023-12-13T16:49:46.000Z

CarShield abuse of policy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"After three years with my car shield policy on my Ford fusion, I added my Subaru Crosstrek and three months after having my cross trek the hybrid motor needed to be rebuilt and because of a bulletin from 2017 the claim was denied and I’m sure with this scam company Anytime you submit a claim for anything they’re gonna come up with a reason as to why it’s not covered under the policy even though you have the highest policy covering everything possible I canceled my two policies. I would never recommend Carshield and their TV advertisements are an absolute abuse of customer relations. When we first submitted the claim it took 10 days of back-and-forth before we could open up a claim they wouldn’t submit the parts list from me the customer they had to speak with the dealership and the Subaru dealership in Tucson Arizona. Service department were very laid-back and lazy and did nothing in an attempt to get the job Which would have netted them an $8000 service you think they would’ve worked the little harder. The service manager was less responsive than the front desk people I would never recommend service at Tucson Subaru either. It’s really a shame to say that customer service has really been lost , in this new generation",2023-11-21T18:46:21.000Z

CarShield denied our claim simply because the exhaust tip had been replaced. Makes no sense... they deny head gaskets because of an exhaust tip. CarShield is a money racket and a scam. We went over the pamphlet and policy they sent us and there was nothing in it that mentioned even aftermarket parts or replaced parts. This truck has 200K miles on it, I would be shocked it something hadn't been replaced. We paid out well over 3K for this policy and could have just put that to getting the truck fixed ourselves.",2023-11-21T15:17:45.000Z

CarShield is no bueno,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"CarShield advertises paying for a premium with a deductible but for almost every claim I had to pay close to half of all the total expenses. They try their hardest to disqualify you for everything they can even if it’s covered under your plan. Every claim they made sure I wouldn’t get reimbursed for the rental and the last one was the last straw, they sent the part themself instead of the repair shop ordering the part which took about 3 weeks total for the part and me calling every few days and even after they ensured I would be covered for the rental they refused to pay for one dollar and I finally just said forget it I’ll just save the money vs giving it to them. I have no idea how they have 4.1 in reviews almost every repair shop refused to work with the warranty completely and the one that did they gave a terrible time every claim and I don’t drive a beat up car it’s a newer Mercedes in great condition",2023-11-21T03:19:39.000Z
